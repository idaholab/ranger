I found some useful example in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/auxkernels/VolumeAux.html.\nI run the example and got the result below:\nThis was the mesh of the problem:\n\nThis was the volume output of the problem:\n\nI am a little confused since I thought the output volume didn't match the real situation.\nI went to the source code and found the volume was calculated using return _bnd ? _current_side_volume : _current_elem_volume;. I thought it should calculate the volume of the mesh. I might misunderstood something and perhaps there were some problems with my output method. I am wondering if anyone can get me some suggestions on getting the volume of the mesh. I should use this value as a parameter in developing my own application.\nThank you so much for your help.",

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI am exploring the functionality built into MOOSE for building surrogate models. I am playing around with a very simple example of a heat sink conducting into air. When I run the input file on its own the solver converges fine however when I then go to train my nearest point surrogate I am getting lots of errors about the solve failing to converge. I think this maybe because my sample is not being parsed through correct?\n\n radiator_steady.i \n\n[Mesh]\n  [file]\n    type = FileMeshGenerator\n    file = 'radiator_smaller.msh'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n    [T]\n    []\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [radiator_ic]\n    type = ConstantIC\n    variable = T\n    value = 373.15\n    block = 'inner_surface'\n  []\n  [air_ic]\n    type = ConstantIC\n    variable = T\n    value = 283.15\n    block = 'outer_surface'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [hc]\n    type = ADHeatConduction\n    variable = T\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n    [radiator]\n        type = ADHeatConductionMaterial\n        thermal_conductivity = 386\n        specific_heat = 389\n        block = 'inner_surface'\n    []\n    [radiator_density]\n        type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n        prop_names = 'density'\n        prop_values = 8960\n        block = 'inner_surface'\n    []\n    [air]\n        type = ADHeatConductionMaterial\n        thermal_conductivity = 0.025\n        specific_heat = 1000\n        block = 'outer_surface'\n    []\n    [air_density]\n        type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n        prop_names = 'density'\n        prop_values = 1.2754\n        block = 'outer_surface'\n    []\n[]\n\n[Preconditioning]\n  [smp]\n    type = SMP\n    full = false\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n    automatic_scaling = true\n    line_search = 'default'\n    type = Steady\n    solve_type = 'NEWTON'\n    petsc_options_iname='-pc_type'\n    petsc_options_value='lu'\n[]\n\n[Postprocessors]\n  [T_avg]\n    type = AverageNodalVariableValue\n    variable = T\n  []\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n[]\n\n\n\n nearest_point_training.i \n\n[StochasticTools]\n[]\n\n[Distributions]\n    [rad_k]\n        type = Uniform\n        lower_bound = 300\n        upper_bound = 500\n    []\n    [rad_h]\n        type = Uniform\n        lower_bound = 300\n        upper_bound = 500\n    []\n[]\n\n[Samplers]\n    [sample]\n        type = LatinHypercube\n        distributions = 'rad_k rad_h'\n        num_rows = 100\n        execute_on = PRE_MULTIAPP_SETUP\n    []\n[]\n\n[MultiApps]\n    [sub]\n      type = SamplerFullSolveMultiApp\n      input_files = radiator_steady.i\n      sampler = sample\n    []\n  []\n  \n  [Controls]\n    [cmdline]\n      type = MultiAppSamplerControl\n      multi_app = sub\n      sampler = sample\n      param_names = 'Materials/radiator/thermal_conductivity Materials/radiator/specific_heat'\n    []\n  []\n\n  [Transfers]\n    [data]\n      type = SamplerReporterTransfer\n      from_multi_app = sub\n      sampler = sample\n      stochastic_reporter = results\n      from_reporter = 'T_avg/value'\n    []\n  []\n  \n  [Reporters]\n    [results]\n      type = StochasticReporter\n      outputs = none\n    []\n  []\n\n  [Trainers]\n    [nearest_point_avg]\n      type = NearestPointTrainer\n      execute_on = timestep_end\n      sampler = sample\n      response = results/data:T_avg:value\n    []\n  []\n\n  [Outputs]\n    [out]\n      type = SurrogateTrainerOutput\n      trainers = 'nearest_point_avg'\n      execute_on = FINAL\n    []\n  []\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

                  "bodyText": "Hi,\nYour inputs look fine to me. What exactly is the error you are getting? Is the radiator_steady.i solve not converging? One thing to try is to check if the solve converges with the bounds of your distributions. For instance, setting Materials/radiator/thermal_conductivity=500. This will tell you if your physics is having a difficult time converging.\nI'd be happy to try it out myself, but I will need the mesh file you have.\nZach",

I was wondering if there is any way to use 1D flow channels (specifically FlowChannel1Phase) that are at an angle or incline, as shown in the piece of art I have attached. If I try and change the orientation vector I get a reminder that these components should be aligned with one of the axes. It may be that there is no way round this currently. If so, is there any chance it will be added in future? Many thanks for any help.\n\n)",

The damage resulting from irradiation induced swelling is then captured through the thermal strains calculated from ComputeThermalExpansionEigenstrain.\n\nI am currently looking at a suitable 3D axisymmetric model from the repository that will form the basis for my model. As far as i checked most of them were reduced 2D models with coord_type set to RZ. I wonder how would this command look like if i want to use a 3D model. I am aware a 2D model would suffice for most of the cases, unless if one want to address problems relating to stress effects in the vicinity of the circumference e.g., torsion. My intention here is to compare with analytical results for which a 3D FE model would result in a better comparision.\nKind regards,\nArun",

However in my case make always exited with an error when it came to compile the F90 part of the UMAT. So I went and asked my master thesis supervisor for help.\nHere is how he solved it: He used @GiudGiud's recommended make -n  command to get get the flags MOOSE uses for compiling. Then, following those commands, he wrote a script that creates the .plugin file you need for MOOSE externally. You can then simply copy that file into the MOOSE plugins folder and it seems to work just fine.",

It has 46,800 elements, 17 variables and 570,000 degrees of freedom.\n\nI used the lu method and the petsc settings are as follows:\n  petsc_options = '-snes_converged_reason -ksp_converged_reason -snes_linesearch_monitor'\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_factor_shift_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu       NONZERO'\n  line_search = 'none'\n\nBut when I run it on a computer with 64GB of RAM, the RAM is full and no results are produced. I think that the memory occupied by MOOSE may be too large, and it is not feasible to deal with some large-scale problems. Or is there some problem with my PETSc setup. I have tried ilu but the results do not converge, and only when using lu (maybe set to other options will also converge). Can you give me some advice on saving memory and guaranteeing convergence?",

If the problem of 17 variables and 50,000 grids already requires 64GB of memory, wouldn't the problem of 5 million grids require 7TB of memory? This is obviously not realistic.
