However, when I try to change the decomposition type to \"spectral\", the solver always fails to converge at the early steps of the simulation. I've already tried to use different petsc options, mesh, displacement increment, nothing works. I'm also running 2 versions: monolithic and staggered schemes (one single app and using multiapp). I'm sending attached the monolithic version that works with volumetric deviatoric.\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to get this to work with spectral decomposition? Thank you!\nsent.zip",

                  "bodyText": "Hi\nSo I see a few problems with these inputs.\nBoth solves are on the same mesh, which lets me think that you do not want to be using a variable value sample transfer. This is to take the variable value at a point in the mesh, and create a simulation that is local to that point. For a multiscale approach basically.\nI think you want to be using a MultiAppCopyTrasnfer, to transfer the full field from one app to the other.\nThen disp_x, c are primary variables in both applications. You cant transfer to primary variables, since these are the variables you are solving for. You need to trasnfer to an auxiliary variable with a different name, then use it as an initial condition for the primary variable. Or at least that's what I think you should do, but it really depends on what your coupling scheme is.\nhold that thought, I need to check on this\nEDIT: took a long time to type. I saw you fixed issue number 1\nGuillaume",

It needs first to project the material property to the nodes and then interpolate it back to quadrature points. This will cause accuracy issue. In addition, you should not use CONSTANT MONOMIAL for elastic_energy because that averages the material property as a single value. I am not sure quite sure if the FIRST MONOMIAL would work or not, but you can give it a shot. You can output material property by adding outputs = exodus to visualize them in paraview. Take a look at if you get nonzero elastic energy in the sub app.\nI suggest you transfer displacement variables and recompute the elastic energy in the fracture app. We have been using that for the staggered approach. A better approach is to transfer the material property directly, but as you already discovered, that is not supported yet.\nLastly, you need to add Picard iteration to ensure your solution converges for each time step.",

The patches emit rays using gaussian quadrature.\nHowever, this model seems like it may break down with highly reflective surfaces like polished aluminum.  If the surface is highly reflective, then shouldn't the patches be modeled based on the angle of incident rays?  In that case, I would expect the radiative heat transfer to be calculated from rays reflected multiple times, rather than having each ray die at its first intersection with a boundary.\nDoes this make sense?  If so, is there a way to allow RadiationTransferAction to reflect rays a few times before killing them?",

The case of polished Al would be better described by specular reflection which net radiation transfer typically excludes. The difference is that of a white and specular reflected boundary in radiation transport. Note that most engineering surfaces are some mixture of the two.\nTo the question about view factors and rays. @GiudGiud already explained it but I want to add one thing. View factors are essentially first flight surface to surface collision probabilities from the collision probability method in radiation transport. The probability that a photon released in direction Omega makes its first contact with surface patch j. The radiative exchange is can be computed from these first flight exchange probabilities by a little bit of book-keeping and math. That is essentially what @GiudGiud described.\nThat bookkeeping includes diffuse reflection, absorption, and radiation. That is why rays are killed at first contact with the next surface...it's because we only want first flight surface-to-surface collision probabilities.\nNOTE: the full problem with specular reflection, energy dependence, and absorption in any media within the cavity can also be solved using the MOOSE based radiation transport application Griffin.",
