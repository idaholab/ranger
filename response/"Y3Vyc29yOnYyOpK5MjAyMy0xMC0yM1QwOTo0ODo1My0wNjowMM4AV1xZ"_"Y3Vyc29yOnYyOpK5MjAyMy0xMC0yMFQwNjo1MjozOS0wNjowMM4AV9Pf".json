In the meantime, since this is part of a larger problem using a specific version of moose (from earlier this year) I was looking into something that can be used in the interim until we can update the full package.\nSince I believe the core of the problem that you are stating is that the kernels are creating a coupled problem by default. I noticed that Heat Conduction kernel takes a displacements and use_displaced_mesh option. If I were to leave the displacments defined in the mesh could I use the use-displaced_mesh = false in the kernels blocks to decouple? Would that achieve the same result until we can update the MOOSE install?",

For most applications that is fine; but in some cases the two blocks might be translated from each other.\nOne potential use is for tensor mechanics periodic boundary value problems in which the RVE shape is not a rectangle. Then the paired surfaces still match up but are offset by some vector. For a rectangular RVE, the pairs are opposite along the normal direction.\nI already implemented and verified it in 2d and 3d in the lower level functions such that boundary_offset is the only additional user parameter on the MortarConstraint objects, and its default value is a zero vector.",

However, I have checked the source code of DynamicMaster, and found that this kernel only supports a handcoded implicit hht format.\nI have two questions, and I would greatly appreciate your assistance and guidance:\n\n\nFirstly, I would like to inquire if there are any plans by the official team to introduce an explicit dynamics module to the Tensor Mechanical? If such plans exist, could you provide insights into the expected timeline or milestones for this development?\n\n\nIf I intend to code an explicit dynamics kernel myself, could you offer any advice or guidance on where to begin? Such guidance would be invaluable for my project within Moose.In addition, the explicit dynamics solution format itself isn't complicated. However, I observed that the Jacobi matrix is always computed in the MOOSE solution procedure, but the Jacobi matrix is not required in explicit dynamics and there is no convergence problem. Does this feature conflict with and MOOSE's solution framework?\n\n\nThank you very much for your time and assistance, and I look forward to your response.\nSen",

But I don't know exactly where your interests are, so I can't provide more specifics.\nRegarding your last question. The fact that MOOSE typically builds a Jacobian matrix isn't a big hurdle to do explicit. As I mentioned above, that's already possible with the code in the repository.",

The problem I am interested in is the fragmentation of a metallic cylindrical shell under explosive loading, where the material will be subjected to tens of Gpa of loading in a few microseconds - an extreme nonlinear problem involving fracture. If computed using implicit integration, the extreme nonlinearity will lead to difficulties in convergence ( which I have already encountered) as the stiffness matrix needs to be computed and Jacobi matrices introduced at each step. In contrast, in the explicit dynamics computational format, the information on the current time can be obtained directly from the information on the previous step, without the need to introduce Jacobi matrices and iterations, which is very favourable for solving impact fracture problems. This is why I wanted to compute this problem via explicit dynamics.\nHowever, in the MOOSE code, the solution format in DynamicStressDivergenceTensors is a hard-coded form of Hilber-Hughes-Taylor time integration - which is an implicit format. Therefore, I don't think that the central difference scheme in executioner overrides this solution format, and I think it may only be in effect when calculating the displacement variable, refer to this discussion: #24896.\nTherefore, I would still like to ask this question: does this feature of showing that no Jacobi matrix is needed in the dynamics computation conflict with moose's solution framework? Many thanks!",

          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE experts,\nBackground:\nI am currently working on developing a coupling model that combines crystal plasticity (CP) and phase field (PF) approaches. In my pursuit, I have encountered a challenge for which I seek your guidance. Unfortunately, the issue raised in request #25687 remains unresolved, and I have not received a response from the author of the respective email. To address this situation, I am considering implementing the code myself, drawing inspiration from two key research papers:\nRef. 1. On the plastic driving force of grain boundary migration: A fully coupled phase field and crystal plasticity model\nRef. 2. An integrated fast Fourier transform-based phase-field and crystal plasticity approach to model recrystallization of three-dimensional polycrystals\nThese papers describe a crucial data transformation process, transitioning from the shape interface (crystal plasticity) to the diffuse interface (phase field). Specifically, at each integration point [_qp]  of each element, there is now a unique material parameter derived from the crystal plasticity FEM, such as the second Piola-Kirchhoff tensor S. Ref. 2 suggests that we should compute the averages S_i = <S>_i of the second Piola-Kirchhoff tensor over all elements belonging to each grain i within the entire CP-FEM computational domain.\nQuestion:\nMy specific inquiry pertains to how to calculate these averages S_i = <S>_i for each grain i from the S tensor data obtained through crystal plasticity calculations. Essentially, I seek guidance on how to extract all S[_qp] values of all elements within the region of grain i and subsequently compute their average.\nSpecifically, I think two std::maps need to be created based on GrainTracker, one is used to store the map from grain id to the vector of element id, and the other is used to store the map of grain id to the average value of the material property.\nI would greatly appreciate any suggestions, recommendations, or insights to address this challenge and successfully develop the coupling model.\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nWarm regards,\nWei Peng",
