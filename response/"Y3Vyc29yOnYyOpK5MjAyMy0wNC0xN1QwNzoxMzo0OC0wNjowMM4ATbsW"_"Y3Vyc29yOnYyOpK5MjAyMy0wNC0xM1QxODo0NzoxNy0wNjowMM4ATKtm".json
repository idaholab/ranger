The input deck here is a simplified version of my real problem but includes all aspects. The real problem has more blocks and contact pairs, and the majority of the DOF is in the interior. The thermal mechanical problem is overly resolved for the coupling of a phase-field subapp (not mentioned in the simplified input deck here).\n\nI have tried using Preconditioning/FSP but it ran into error\n\nLinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_PC_FAILED iterations 0\n                 PC failed due to SUBPC_ERROR \nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN iterations 0\n\n\nany recommendation on the petsc_options, petsc_options_iname, petsc_options_value when the lowerDblock for contact pairs is of 100k nodes and the interior 1M of nodes.\n\nThe input deck is based on #24019 and modified as follows (mostly direct copy from test files.

There is a way to avoid this by fixing the particle and assigning unit shape tensor, which is already implemented in the peridynamics module. Further, the shape tensor eliminator user object can be used to break all the bonds of a particle whose shape tensor is singular, since the particle is fixed anyway.",

Are the results reasonable or do I misunderstand somewhere? Here are the input files I used. Thanks. https://github.com/rh201/New-Lagrangian-Kernels.git",
