          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI have worked on tutorial #1 and moved forward by your help. Thanks a lot.\nOne thing I noticed was that there has been \"Permission denied\" error whenever I created, edited, and saved input files and source codes using ATOM. So far, I have provided the permission to each file using \"chmod +rw\" command manually. As you expected, it is time consuming. Is there any way to give the permission to files created/modified by ATOM easily?\nSincerely,\nSung",

                  "bodyText": "The first thing that comes to my mind - do you launch atom using sudo? If opened as root, even once, a given file (or project directory) could have screwed up permissions like this. Changing a single file back to the proper permissions wouldn't fix an entire directory tree that is screwed up in this way.\nAlternatively, do you install packages using the apm install command on the command line? This is mentioned in the Atom Editor Setup page on the MOOSE website. I am wondering if you accidentally used sudo apm install which might have screwed up permissions in your Atom installation, and is spilling down to what you edit using it. Though that's a bit more far-fetched, perhaps.",

This file is created after using sudo so that the system knows not to show a bunch of warnings about the dangers of sudo to you after you've used the command once.

Therefore, it is recommended that a Linux native editor is used.

Besides having to build the MPI mpich2 from scratch, we were able to follow the Linux build instructions very closely and ended up with fully featured MOOSE app executables.\nTo improve the user experience, the MOOSE integration for autocompletion[2] in the Atom editor[3] was improved to work on Windows allowing the native Windows version of Atom to be used to edit files inside the WSL2 container. WSL2 files are made available in Windows through a virtual network share located at \\\\wsl$\\distribution\\path. The moose-autocomplete plugin for Atom obtains a description of valid application syntax by running a MOOSE app using the --json commandline switch. This causes the app to output JSON data describing all valid parameters for all available objects for the given app \u2014 rather than statically supplying a syntax description which would quickly go out of date as soon as objects in a MOOSE-based application are added or modified.\nThe MOOSE-autocomplete plugin detects whenever a file is located within a WSL2 container and uses the Windows wsl command to discover and execute a MOOSE app executable within the WSL2 container. The entire process is seamless to the user. Figure 6.2 shows a screenshot of a native Atom editor being used to edit a MOOSE inputfile within a WSL2 container with working autocompletion. We believe WSL2 to be a suitable avenue for making MOOSE available on Windows systems as it very closely maps to our current Linux based testing and development infrastructure.",

Based on the input file grain_growth_3D.i, I have some questions and hope to get your guidance and corrections.\nThe following is my understanding and confusion,\nFirst of all, why is there no BCs block in grain_growth_3D.i?\nSecond, in AuxVariables and AuxKernels, apart from bnds,I do not understand what other auxiliary variables and kernels are used for? in other words:\n\nIn AuxVariables, what are the meanings of unique_grains, var_indices, ghost_regions, and halos and what are their functions?\nIn AuxKernels, what are the functions implemented by flood_counter = grain_tracker and flood_counter = voronoi? I did not find the relevant option in FeatureFloodCountAux.\nWhat does field_display = VARIABLE_COLORING mean in AuxKernels? Other options such as: What do VARIABLE_COLORING and GHOSTED_ENTITIES mean?\n[AuxKernels] [./var_indices] type = FeatureFloodCountAux variable = var_indices flood_counter = grain_tracker field_display = VARIABLE_COLORING execute_on = 'initial timestep_end' [../] ...\n\nFinally, the input file input is a *_out.e file, but the multiple input files output in grain_growth_2D_voronoi.i, what input code determines the extension of the .e result file input one or more?\nAny suggestions or recommendations to fix these problems would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you\nWei Peng",

After the grain_growth_3D.i simulation is completed, only one out.e file is generated. However, grain_growth_2D_voronoi.i simulation generated hundreds of out.e files. So my question is what code in the input file affects the generation of one or more out.e files?",

The idea is to asses the interference between the wells (overlapping of well cones) and the interaction that they have with the river. Also, at some point, the level of the river increases and a contaminant is injected in it. Here, the objective is to asses whether the contaminant get into the pumped water by the wells.\nIs possible to perform such models with MOOSE?\nIf so, is it a correct/realistic description of the wells the \"point source sink\"? As, for example, the Theis example displayed on the groundwater models example page? Seems the most reasonable approach to simulate a cone and I also have external data on pumping rates so I can combine it with PorousFlowPointSourceFromPostprocessor.\nThanks and sorry for the simple question, I am new with MOOSE\nMatias Castillo",

I\u2019m not sure if there are examples for contaminant transport though. Probably Andy can comment on that.\nRegarding your extraction well set up, as Maelle and Andy nicely demonstrated at the end of the 'groundwater examples'  is always better to use boreholes. Plus, is often good to document a Theis example since is useful as verification of a well-known problem, but be aware that in that case the aquifer is saturated so is not really a \u2018cone drawdown\u2019.\nSetting up a borehole in Porous Flow is quite simple, I suggest you to take a look at bh02.i and bh03.i tests here. Just be aware that you will have to set porepressure instead of fluxes in your MOOSE input file.\nCheers!\nJose",

                  "bodyText": "Hi Matias,\nYes, this is exactly the sort of thing that can be done with PorousFlow.  I've run almost exactly this sort of simulation in the past (for me, the boreholes were pumping the contaminant, and the stream was receiving it).  As mentioned in the groundwater doco, setting up your mesh will turn out to be the most difficult thing.\nWhether you use just a single point for your well depends on the resolution of your problem.  You clearly don't need more than 1 point per finite element, since the finite element size dictates the resolution of the problem, but if your wells span multiple finite elements you'll probably want to model them using multiple points (just include more points in the borehole's geometry file).\nYes, you can simply use PorousFlowPointSourceFromPostprocessor and prescribe a pumping rate.  The only thing you have to be careful with is prescribing an unrealistically high pumping rate (compared with the aquifer hydraulic conductivity) and then the hydraulic heads or porepressures become unrealistically negative (corresponding to desaturation of the aquifer).\nYes, you can include contaminants: you will utilize the mass_fraction_vars input if you are using one of the PorousFlow Actions.  I suggest you start by reading this tutorial page:  https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/tutorial_06.html .    Then, you need to read the \"numerical diffusion\" page: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/numerical_diffusion.html  .   Perhaps you don't need to understand everything on that page, but you certainly need to appreciate the concept of numerical diffusion, because it is likely to impact your \"break-through\" times and your interpretation of your results.  That knowledge will be valuable, even if you judge that no stabilization is needed for your problem (I would start with no stabilization and see if your results are adequate, since that's the easiest).\nRegarding the contaminants, if you issue this command in the moose/porous_flow directory\nfind . -name \"*.i\" | xargs grep mass_fraction_vars\n\nyou will see a lot of tests that you can follow, in addition to the ones mentioned in the above doco pages.\nFinally, are you willing to share your results?  It's hard to tell, but they might be a useful addition to the \"Groundwater Modelling\" page that Maelle and I wrote.\nandy",

Thanks also for the borehole examples, that's really helpful! Saludos \ud83d\udc4d\n@WilkAndy\nI would be happy to share the results plus the model with the community once is finished. I still need to generate a realistic mesh, but for now I just have a quadratic one with three layers, that makes the job.\nThe first step would be running a steady state simulation with the pumps and the river and asses the interaction among them. As I understand, there are two options to set the wells:\n1.- PorousFlowPointSourceFromPostprocessor - I can set up flows from external file but is not as realistic as a borehole. Further, it has to be set at a node of the mesh.\n2.- PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole - More realistic and it can be propositioned anywhere in the mesh. However, there is not direct way to control the pumped flow. This has to be tuned by setting a 'bottom' porepressure.\nIs that correct?\nTo asses the interaction among wells, how can I obtain the capture zone of the wells (streamlines)?\nThanks for the quick replies!\nMatias Castillo",

You may position it anywhere in the mesh, and it withdraws the amount of water specified in the postprocessor.  You just must be careful with interpreting the results.  Let's say you position the borehole points so they lie directly in the middle of finite elements.  Then the water withdrawal will occur equally from the water at each of the nodes of those finite elements: it's as if you had an enormous element-sized borehole that abstracts water.  This is not wrong - it's just a reflection of the fact that your resolution in a finite-element model is set by the element size.  On the other hand, if you position the borehole points so they lie exactly on nodes then the water withdrawal will occur from those nodes only.  This does not make your simulation significantly more accurate, since your resolution is still set by the element size - it's just easier to convince yourself that the results are actually more accurate!\nRegarding the streamlines - you could use a PorousFlowDarcyVelocityComponent AuxVariable and plot the flow directions in paraview.",

Not exactly sure why we didn't see this error immediately after the first version of moose-libmesh rolled out the door.\nWhat I think we need to do, is include sed as a requirement when building/running libMesh. That way when moose-libmesh is installed, the dependency sed will also be installed, and hopefully be available in the same location as it was during build. Conda does some magical things when it prepares a package... hopefully it corrects more than just link lines (libtool is a script, and I am not sure Conda sniffs out paths inside scripts when it corrects/prepares them for redistribution)",

One thing I noticed is that in order to compile libmesh (despite activating petsc and the moose utils from the env in conda), I must set all CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CFLAGS, FFLAGS. Before I was having errors related to the metaphysicl package.\nSo far configuring libmesh seems to run (not yet finished though) and will see if moose also compiles fine.\nThanks again for the support,\nMauro",
