The calculation result shows that v is calculated after u is completed.\nBut what I want is that the program can then update some parameter from v, and then repeatedly compute u and v until the ending condition is satisfied.\nI then tried to the cases of execute_on = LINEAR or NONLINEAR, but the convergence was not good.\nSo, I tried changing the u executioner to be Transient, giving it a large num steps, but setting steady_state_detection = true, and execute_on = 'timestep_end'.\nHere, for each time step, u and v will be fully calculated and the parameters will be updated. When satisfies nl_abs_tol, the Transient calculation will be ended, and the calculation speed is also good.\nNext, I will try to implement FP-iterations to solve the problem and have a comparison.\nThank you again.

          "bodyText": "This geometry always appears in the solid nuclear reactor core: cylinder and hollow cylinders with the same axial line - rod, gas gap, clad, shown in this figure(top view):\n\nI want to solve the thermal expansion for this problem.\n\nA natural thought is to only model rod and clad mesh. The mesh volumes remain void on the gas gap position. I use HeatConduction and HeatSource Kernels, [Modules/TensorMechanics/Master]. The temperature on the outer side of the rod or inner side of the clad is got from GapHeatTransfer. This method will be feasible for only one channel in this picture. But for tens or hundreds channels? It will cost lots of time which is unacceptable.\nAnother thought is to use different domains for Heat Conduction Module and Solid Mechanics Module: For Heat Conduction Module - rod, gas gap, clad; For Solid Mechanics Module:  rod, clad. But in this method, I encounter an error about negative Jacobian\n\nThis method I cannot know the way to achieve it. Omit the gas gap for both rod and clad. In the Heat Conduction Module, try to make the temperature abrupt change to represent the thermal resistance caused by gas gap. In the Solid Mechanics Module, the displacement for the rod block and clad block is the same based on the assumption. However, I cannot find the way to achieve this....\nSo what's your suggestions? Do you know how to solve thermal expansion problems with tens (or hundreds) of gas gap, or find ways to achieve 3)?",
