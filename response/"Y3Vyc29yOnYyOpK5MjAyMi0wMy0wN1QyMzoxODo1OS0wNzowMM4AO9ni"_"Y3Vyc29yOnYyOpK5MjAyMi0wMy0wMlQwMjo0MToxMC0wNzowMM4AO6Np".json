The time step is so small that the right hand side of the linear system is zero, and then the direction is zero.

Over the past two weeks, I have been going through the tutorials and workshops and have been fascinated with this framework and the materials available for learning.\nI have a general question. I am doing research on subsurface flow problems and occasionally dealing with systems with nonconvex meshes. If I am not mistaken, FEM is not the best method for general polygonal elements such as might be found in reservoir simulation. I was wondering if there is any plan in future to incorporate Virtual Element (VEM) in Moose.\nThank you :-)",

(PBP) but the documentation is a bit scarce, https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/preconditioners/PhysicsBasedPreconditioner.html. Would I be better off doing a thermal solve, then pass that thermal solution to a subapp to solve the mechanical part of the problem? Or can someone hint at the right way to set this up as a PBP?",

I will track it down to reproduce the issue. Regarding the performance, there are many options that can effect performance.   If the other FE code is using PETSc solvers, could you share the results of \"-snes_view\" if the other FE code uses nonlinear solvers, otherwise \"-ksp_view\".\nWith that results, we could setup the same thing for you at the MOSOE side.",

Right now, our DM interface in MOOSE is incomplete. In the current use case, we have to involve DM since FSP is set up via DM.\nThe short-term solution is to use HYPRE instead of GAMG. I believe you will have a similar performance by replacing GAMG with hypre in FSP.\nThe long-term solution is to enhance the DM interface in MOOSE #20420.

The next nearest thing I can do is a thermal solve, pass that data do the mechanical subapp using the temp as an aux field. I'm trying to achieve similar scaling to his problem, for example, with my full of the problem I can solve 300 timesteps in 12 hours, which I was pretty happy with, but to get that performance I used 360 MPI tasks, 6 tasks per socket which equates to a total of 3360 CPUS reserved (360 being used) across 60 nodes. He was able to do the same with 5 nodes using fully utilised machine, doing all timesteps in 2.5 hours.\nThis works out to be 23 seconds per fully converged NL cycle in FENICS and over 375 seconds with MOOSE, using my original PC settings. Fenics doesnt update the mesh, this incurs a cost in time. Maybe I should try the initial precondition only. So thats the motivation here, to figure out what the source of this performance gulf is.",

The StressUpdate version has several robustness and speed advantages, which @dewenyushu has shown elsewhere. Additionally, it will be more straightforward to refactor the monothlithic-based code to the StressUpdate version since both versions are solely Material classes.\nThanks!\nStephanie",
