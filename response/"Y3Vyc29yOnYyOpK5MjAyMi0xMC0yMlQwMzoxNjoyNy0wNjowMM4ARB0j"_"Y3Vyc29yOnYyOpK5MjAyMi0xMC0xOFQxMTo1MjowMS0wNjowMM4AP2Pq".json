You can easily reproduce 0.1 T with a real Function by specifying a PiecewiseLinear function for example.\n\n\nNote: this parameter abuses Functions in that it takes 'x' to be temperature. So instead of having a spatial dependence, they have a temperature dependence. The ParsedFunction you could pass here would be: 0.1 * x\nGuillaume",

In your input file, you might have a strain calculator that calculates a material property called \"elastic_strain\" or \"mechanical_strain\" based on the current displacements. What you want to do here, is to add a condition in your strain calculator such that, if the value of your coupled order parameter is above (or below) certain value, you set the _elastic_strain[_qp] = 0.
