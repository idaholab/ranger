          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE Experts,\nHere, I created a pull requests expecting to introduce grain boundary energy and grain boundary mobility anisotropy due to grain boundary misorientation in moose's grain growth simulation. But here are some questions to ask you.\nWhen I code the ComputePolycrystalGBAnisotropy material object to get the grain misorientation _delta_theta at each quadrature point, based on the Euler angles from file.\nThen, GBAnisotropyMisorientation was created to compute the model parameters $\\kappa(\\theta), L(\\theta), \\gamma(\\theta)$ and m in the multi-order phase field model, which refer to GBAnisotropy and B. Misorientation dependence in Nele Moelans' PRB.\nThe only difference between GBAnisotropyMisorientation and GBAnisotropy is that the gb energy $\\sigma_{gb}$ and gb mobility $\\mu_{gb}$ output by GBAnisotropyMisorientation are not based on the array[num_op, num_op] given in the file, but are calculated based on the misorientation $\\theta$ given by this quadrature point.\nNext, when I create an example, anisotropic_GB_100_N0load.i, based on grain_growth_2D_graintracker.i and add the following code in the material module,\n[Materials]\n  [./CuGrGr]\n    # Material properties\n    type = GBAnisotropyMisorientation # GBAnisotropyEvolutionBase GBEvolution GBAnisotropyMisorientation\n    T = 450 # Constant temperature of the simulation (for mobility calculation)\n    wGB = 14 # Width of the diffuse GB\n    GBmob0 = 2.5e-6 #m^4(Js) for copper from Schoenfelder1997\n    Q = 0.23 #eV for copper from Schoenfelder1997\n    GBenergy = 0.708 #J/m^2 from Schoenfelder1997\n    outputs = my_exodus\n    # output_properties = 'M_GB GBenergy' \n  [../]\n  [./GBMisorientation]\n    type = ComputePolycrystalGBAnisotropy\n    grain_tracker = grain_tracker\n    euler_angle_provider = euler_angle_file\n    outputs = my_exodus\n    output_properties = delta_theta\n  [../]\n[]\nBut here I have two problems,\nFirst, when I set $\\sigma_{gb}(\\theta)$ and $\\mu_{gb}(\\theta)$ are based on the expressions in the jianbao gao's article as follows,\n$$\n\\sigma(\\theta)=\\sigma_{H A B} \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{H A B}}\\left[1-\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{H A B}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mu(\\theta)=\\mu_{\\mathrm{HAB}}\\left(1-\\exp \\left[-B\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{HAB}}}\\right)^{n}\\right]\\right)\n$$\nThe calculation does not converge directly, as shown below\nSolve failed, cutting timestep.\n\nTime Step 1, time = 1e-13, dt = 1e-13\nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN iterations 0\n\ufffd[31m Solve Did NOT Converge!\ufffd[39m\nAborting as solve did not converge\n\nSecond, when I refer to the setting method in the Ying Liu's article, add two constants to the above two formulas, and put $\\sigma_{gb,max}(\\delta \\theta) / \\sigma_{gb,min}(\\delta \\theta)$ and $\\mu_{gb.max}(\\delta \\theta) / \\mu_{gb, min}(\\delta \\theta)$ set to 5 can be calculated.\n$$\n\\sigma(\\theta)=4\\sigma_{H A B} \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{H A B}}\\left[1-\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{H A B}}\\right)\\right]+\\sigma_{H A B}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu(\\theta)=4\\mu_{\\mathrm{HAB}}\\left(1-\\exp \\left[-B\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\hat{\\theta}{\\mathrm{HAB}}}\\right)^{n}\\right]\\right)+\\mu{\\mathrm{HAB}}\n$$\nThe figure below is the output material parameters,\n\nBy the way, in the phase field model adopted in jianbao gao's article and Ying Liu's article, grain boundary energy and grain boundary mobility are directly related to the phase field free energy functional. In Nele Moelans' PRB, the phase field model we adopt is indirectly related to these two parameters.\nHowever, the migration of gb during the simulation process is very strange. Specifically, there are three points: a) high-angle grain boundaries do not have smooth grain boundaries, and b) inappropriately, the movement of grain boundaries is somewhat similar to the reciprocation of water waves movement, c) The width of the grain boundary does not maintain a constant size, please watch the gif animation I uploaded for details,\n\nSo what I want to ask is if my modeling way of setting high grain boundary energy and grain boundary mobility at the grain boundary is itself a mistake. In other words, how should the grain boundary energy and grain boundary mobility anisotropy due to grain boundary misorientation be added to the multi-order parameter phase field model developed by Nele Moelans properly constructed, and expected to reproduce in Ying Liu's paper phenomenon of abnormal grain growth.\nAny suggestions or recommendations to fix these problems would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you\nWei Peng",

The lack of smoothness in the grain boundaries and the jerky motion may be caused by the fact that you need to add more elements through the interfaces to make sure that you still are adequately resolving the diffuse interfaces. Make sure there are still about 3 elements through the interface.",

Before asking my question, I would like to do my best to show my understanding of grain boundary energy or grain boundary mobility modeling based on grain boundary misorientation. My idea of modifying GBAnisotropy is to set mob_ij according to the misorientation, and the same for sigma_ij.\nWhen only considering the grain boundary mobility anisotropy, for a grain boundary containing only two order parameters, I use the order parameter mobility L after GBAnisotropy as shown in the figure,\n\nUsing the same conditions as above, I use the GBAnisotropyGrainGrowth written by myself. Its principle is to traverse whether there are two grain IDs that are not equal to FeatureFloodCount::invalid_id for each elem. If so, set delta_euler to 3 , otherwise set to 0. The result is shown in the figure,\n\nAnd, I plot the two presented results on a graph as follows,\n\nI found that L covers much wider than delta_theta  in the grain boundary region (identified in the picture). This is because only one grain ID is valid in the area identified by the red double arrow, so set delta_theta to 0 in GBAnisotropyGrainGrowth.\nSo the question now is whether it is valid to have two grain IDs at the same time in the area marked by the red snake arrow, instead of only one grain ID being valid at present.  This makes it possible to make the range of misorientation effect effective in the entire grain boundary region.\nThe above are the problems I have encountered so far, any suggestions or recommendations to fix these problems would be greatly appreciated.\nwei",

In the file I'm actually working on, it actually deleted the side sets from the second mesh, not just removed their names, so there's definitely some odd behaviour occuring.\n[Mesh]\n    [Top_Block]\n        type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n        dim = 3\n        nx = 10\n        ny = 10\n        nz = 10\n        xmax = 2\n        ymax = 2\n        zmax = 2\n        xmin = 0\n        ymin = 0\n        zmin = 1\n        boundary_name_prefix = 'Upper'\n        boundary_id_offset = 10\n    []\n    [Bottom_Block]\n        type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n        dim = 3\n        nx = 10\n        ny = 10\n        nz = 10\n        xmax = 2\n        ymax = 2\n        zmax = 1\n        boundary_name_prefix = 'Lower'\n    []\n    [Combine]\n        type = CombinerGenerator\n        inputs = 'Top_Block Bottom_Block'\n        positions = '0 0 0 0.12 0.12 0'\n    []\n[]",

Use the `function` parameter in your time stepper and pass your new function name into it.\n\nStack frames: 13\n0: 0   libmesh_opt.0.dylib                 0x0000000101569ebb libMesh::print_trace(std::__1::basic_ostream<char, std::__1::char_traits<char> >&) + 1067\n1: 1   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x000000010093890b void moose::internal::mooseDeprecatedStream<ConsoleStream const, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, char const (&) [111], char const (&) [131], char const (&) [71], char const (&) [72], char const (&) [97]>(ConsoleStream const&, bool, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&&&, char const (&&&) [111], char const (&&&) [131], char const (&&&) [71], char const (&&&) [72], char const (&&&) [97]) + 843\n2: 2   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x000000010093792d FunctionDT::FunctionDT(InputParameters const&) + 845\n3: 3   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x00000001009373ce std::__1::shared_ptr<MooseObject> moose::internal::buildObj<FunctionDT>(InputParameters const&) + 78\n4: 4   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x0000000100ca7884 Factory::create(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, InputParameters&, unsigned int, bool) + 372\n5: 5   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x000000010044a034 std::__1::shared_ptr<TimeStepper> Factory::create<TimeStepper>(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&, InputParameters&, unsigned int) + 52\n6: 6   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x000000010096e46c SetupTimeStepperAction::act() + 316\n7: 7   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x000000010094027c ActionWarehouse::executeActionsWithAction(std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> > const&) + 940\n8: 8   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x0000000100975af8 ActionWarehouse::executeAllActions() + 184\n9: 9   libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x0000000100d0dec0 MooseApp::runInputFile() + 80\n10: 10  libmoose-opt.0.dylib                0x0000000100d0a1f3 MooseApp::run() + 83\n11: 11  coupled_transport_model-opt         0x000000010011cbe4 main + 180\n12: 12  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff7ec5a3d5 start + 1\n\n\nFramework Information:\nMOOSE Version:           git commit 34fb8fad8f on 2020-08-05\nLibMesh Version:         b06734bc6434171152f3660d00ed34269367477c\nPETSc Version:           3.14.2\nSLEPc Version:           3.14.0\nCurrent Time:            Wed Dec 23 12:30:09 2020\nExecutable Timestamp:    Wed Dec 23 11:19:31 2020\n\nParallelism:\n  Num Processors:          1\n  Num Threads:             1\n\nMesh: \n  Parallel Type:           replicated\n  Mesh Dimension:          2\n  Spatial Dimension:       2\n  Nodes:                   \n    Total:                 102\n    Local:                 102\n  Elems:                   \n    Total:                 50\n    Local:                 50\n  Num Subdomains:          1\n  Num Partitions:          1\n\nNonlinear System:\n  Num DOFs:                306\n  Num Local DOFs:          306\n  Variables:               { \"C\" \"T\" \"H\" } \n  Finite Element Types:    \"LAGRANGE\" \n  Approximation Orders:    \"FIRST\" \n\nAuxiliary System:\n  Num DOFs:                800\n  Num Local DOFs:          800\n  Variables:               { \"Cb_cem\" \"Cb_conc\" \"Cf_cem\" \"Cf_conc\" \"Ct_cem\" ... \"K\" \"dW_dH\" \"tm\" \"w\" \n                             \"xi\" } \n  Finite Element Types:    \"MONOMIAL\" \n  Approximation Orders:    \"CONSTANT\" \n\nExecution Information:\n  Executioner:             Transient\n  TimeStepper:             FunctionDT\n  Solver Mode:             Preconditioned JFNK\n  PETSc Preconditioner:    hypre boomeramg \n\nLEGACY MODES ENABLED:\n This application uses the legacy material output option: material properties are output only on TIMESTEP_END, not INITIAL.

There are two possible reasons:\n\nThe matrix is not right when using new petsc (3.14.2)\n\nor\n\nHypre might change the default setting.\n\nLet us start to debug on the option 1.\nPlease run the code with PETSc 3.13.x and PETSc 3.14.x respectively  using the option \"-ksp_view_pmat\". The purpose is to check if the matrices are the same for both PETSc-3.13 and 3.14.\nWhen we are on this debugging process, please take one time step only, otherwise you will have too much output. That being said, you should change executioner block  to disable adaptive time stepper  and change the number of time steps to 1",

For example, when taking the first step, you may want to evaluate at the initial condition (F(u, lambda=0) = 0) and solve a linear system with the column vector \\partial F/\\partial \\lambda to generate an initial guess u to start evaluate the residual F(u, lambda=s) for the augmented (arc-length) Newton solve.\nIncidentally, I've been unhappy with this situation for a different project and started an implementation in PETSc, using TS where the parameter lambda would be passed as \"time\". That's nice because it has solution monitoring and the interface plumbing, but it's perhaps less intuitive because \"time\" is not monotone. If you want to use arc-length continuation within an outer transient problem, it would probably be better for me to implement in SNES. The downside is I have to add some new interfaces, but maybe not so bad. Does the MOOSE community have a preference between TS and SNES for a path-following solver?",

So I would like to ask what is the model used for the implementation in order to understand the parameters to input.\nThank you in advance!\nMartin",
