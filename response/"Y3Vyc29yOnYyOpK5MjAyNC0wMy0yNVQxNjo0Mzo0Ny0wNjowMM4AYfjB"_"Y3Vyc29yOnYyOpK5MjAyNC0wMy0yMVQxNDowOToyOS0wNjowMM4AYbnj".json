          "bodyText": "Hi, I am trying to solve the heat equation in the frequency domain. I will try to make this post as detailed as possible, but the tldr is that I've done a lot of debugging and narrowed down the issue to either:\n-Incorrect usage of SideSetHeatTransferKernel, or\n-Solution method\nThe input files (and my MOOSE application) referenced in this post can be found here: https://github.com/richmondodufisan/purple/tree/main/FDTR_Simulation_Fourier/3D/Steady_State_Formulation\nThe heat equation in the diffusive (Fourier) regime is:\n\nTaking the Fourier Transform of this, we get:\n\nTo solve this problem numerically, we need to decompose into a coupled system of equations. This is where I discovered the first issue. By decomposing \"T hat\" into U + iV, we can get a system of two equations. However, when I implemented this, while the results were close to the analytical solution, I saw that there was a \"forward\" phase shift instead of a phase lag as expected (i.e phase difference between a modulated heat source and the temperature increase). I fixed this by changing the decomposition to U - iV (which I know is questionable, but it worked), such that the system of equations becomes:\n\nand\n\nI ran a couple of simulations for the SingleLayer_Test.i input file, varying material properties and they all matched with the analytical solution (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13vhZWXeZJLbZuwk0OFUb_Qxw-fBa7lZ7?usp=sharing) pretty well, at least up to the 3rd decimal place. The exodus output also looked fine, we clearly see diffusive behavior at the location of the heat source (below is the real part of the solution):\n\nNext, I tried to extend this to the problem I am actually trying to solve, which consists of two layers with an interface between them. I tried for one mesh refinement, and while the phase calculated was somewhat close, the amplitude was off almost by a factor of 2. The exodus output also looked a bit peculiar, with a weird zone where it should be normal diffusive behavior:\n\nSince I don't really care about the amplitude for my purposes (even though it should have been a warning sign), I tried to refine the mesh to get closer to the analytical phase (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D2EzYUD_GQuQCWPht3R5EaZdGTBTuJn-?usp=sharing). And the result was just completely off.\n\nThis left me baffled, because I would expect that if it were an issue of mesh refinement, the results would be somewhat close, still. I used the same further refined mesh for the single layer model and it converged to the analytical solution!\n\nWhich led me to believe that there is either something wrong with my use of SideSetHeatTransferKernel, or the solution method- maybe MOOSE is having trouble finding a unique solution.\nI used ADKernel to implement the model, and switched to a Finite Difference Preconditioner. I also changed the pc-type to \"lu\" as suggested by @lindsayad when I had a problem with convergence issues in the past. Since I have eliminated the kernel as the culprit (since it is clearly giving the correct solution for a single layer model with no interface), I tried switching the \"var\" and \"neighbor_var\" variables around for SideSetHeatTransferKernel (don't think they should be impacted, but since the sign of the BC term in the finite element discretization changed after I switched the decomposition to U - iV, maybe the normal is defined differently than I thought or something) to no success.\nI am running out of ideas and actually am pretty floored as I've never run a problem where I get completely different results for the same mesh with different refinements, even fracture problems at least show similar patterns. The visual exodus output is a hint that something is not quite right, but I am struggling to think of where else to look. Is there anything I haven't thought of yet that might be worth looking into?",

By my understanding that should be the most accurate way of constructing the Jacobian possible, basically equivalent to an analytical Jacobian if the mesh is fine enough, right? It took 21 hours to solve (as opposed to ~10 minutes with NEWTON, so even if it worked it's unfeasible for practical use), but it still gave me the same result. Does this rule out the solution method as the cause of the error? I was only able to solve for one mesh (because of how long it takes to solve).",

I still do not have a mathematically rigorous reason for that, but I guess I'll figure that out later.\nWhen I got the wrong results, I tried switching around the var and neighbor_var in SideSetHeatTransferKernel for the imaginary and real parts individually (and together), thinking that the change of the sign in the decomposition could be the reason. Apparently this does not have the same effect as what eventually solved it- the solution was to change the interface conductance to a negative value (and leave the var and neighbor_var as they were). I had looked at the source code for SideSetHeatTransferKernel and didn't consider doing this, because the way the jump was calculated in computeQpresidual, switching var and neighbor_var around should have the same effect. So I'm guessing that the error is coming from the Jacobian computed by that Kernel, since it is an analytical Jacobian (not AD). That's the only explanation I could think of. Still doesn't 100% make sense to me, especially since I got extremely different results with the same mesh at different refinements. But it's solved now and I'm relieved!

          "bodyText": "Dear Community,\nI am currently working on a program that requires the use of spherical harmonics functions, and I am wondering if there is any relevant code available in MOOSE. I am aware that MOOSE incorporates Legendre polynomial functions, which led me to inquire about the availability of spherical harmonics functions as well.\nI have attempted to write my own code for spherical harmonics functions. However, I consistently encounter peculiar results during program execution.  Given that my mathematical background is not very strong, I am concerned that my understanding of the spherical harmonics function formulas may be incorrect.\nI believe having access to pre-implemented spherical harmonics functions within MOOSE would significantly facilitate my project's progress. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could confirm the availability of such functionality within MOOSE.\nThank you very much for your assistance.\nSincerely,\nhityyds",
