It seems like SAM treats the boundaries between the blocks as walls.\nThe geometry and mesh are generated using .geo file. The surfaces are merged according to BCs:\nPhysical Surface(\"inlet\") = {102,106,109,112,114};\nPhysical Surface(\"outlet\") = {8,31,54,77};\nPhysical Surface(\"wall\") = {7,9,12,18,20,28,30,32,35,41,43,51,53,55,58,64,66,74,76,78,80,85,86,92,104,108,111,113,153,157,160,163,165};\n\nThe volume (whole) is merged as:\nPhysical Volume(\"fluid\") = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44};\nThe remaining surfaces (between the blocks) are not \"touched\". Then the .geo file opened by gmsh and saved as .msh file:\nMesh.ElementOrder = 1;\u200b \nMesh.MshFileVersion = 2.16;\u200b\nMesh 3;\u200b\nSave \"tamu.msh\";\n\nWhen I get the results it seems like the surfaces between the blocks are treated as walls and fluid cannot penetrate them. How to fix that?",

I made a new application and tried to activate some modules in the make file. But the make command returned nothing (There was no compiling file after changing the module in the make file).\nI gave up and backed to the previous application. But I've got some weird errors to compile the new *.C files. I supposed I had to update moose to solve the problem, where I got several errors to connect the moose repositories. On the first try, it was error 500, and then it was 000 and 404.\nI uninstalled moose, then updated Linux and tried to install it again, where I got the error 404 to connect the moose repository (First discussion). With your help and  Troubleshooting guideline, it was solved, and MOOSE was installed, but in the make step, there were some unfinished jobs and failed (following lines), and the run-tests failed (errors are at the end).\nNote that I tried to fix the problem with the make clobberall and the Build Issues and Failing Tests solution ways, but I have got the same error. Even I uninstalled and reinstalled moose and conda again, and there was the same error.\nI passed a day full of errors, and now I am confused.\nWould you please let me know how I can fix this problem?\nI am looking forward to hearing from you,\nand Thanks in advance for your kind support.\n### last lines of meke step where you can see the error\n\nCompiling C (in opt mode) /home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/mtwist/src/randistrs.c...\nLinking Library /home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/pcre/libpcre-opt.la...\nLinking Library /home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/gtest/libgtest.la...\nLinking Library /home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/hit/libhit-opt.la...\nLinking Executable /home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/exodiff/exodiff...\n/home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/9.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1: undefined reference to `clock_gettime@GLIBC_2.17'\n/home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/9.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1: undefined reference to `__fdelt_chk@GLIBC_2.15'\n/home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/9.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libssl.so.1.1: undefined reference to `memcpy@GLIBC_2.14'\n/home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/9.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1: undefined reference to `getauxval@GLIBC_2.16'\n/home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/9.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/sajjad/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1: undefined reference to `secure_getenv@GLIBC_2.17'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n/home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/moose.mk:370: recipe for target '/home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/exodiff/exodiff' failed\nmake: *** [/home/sajjad/projects/moose/framework/contrib/exodiff/exodiff] Error 1\nmake: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\n\n### run_tests errors\n\nFinal Test Results:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmaterials/derivative_material_interface.ad_bad_evaluation/nan .......................

Specifically, i'm looking to model a scenario where, for an interface between two regions A and B with variable u in region A and variable v in region B, the boundary condition on v at the interface is a function of the value of variable u at the interface.  There also needs to be a mass flux conservation condition at the boundary, however that can be handled using the InterfaceDiffusionFluxMatch interface kernel.  The function takes other variables, e.g. temperature and volume, and so cannot be implemented using the function kernels, as I understand that these only take variables (x, y, z, t).  As this is an equilibrium situation and we can effectively ignore rate effects, the InterfaceReaction interface kernel is not suitable.\nIt strikes me that this should be relatively straightforward to do - has anyone any experience of this problem?  Many thanks.\n**Specifically, this is to implement Sieverts Law at the interface, where C = K * SQRT( P )\nC is the concentration in region B (v) and P is the gas pressure in region A (u).",

As far as I can see, this particular class is used to calculate the yield stress based on the strength coefficient and strain hardening exponent. My question is how is the inelastic strain calculated while using this class? Is it directly inherited from IsotropicPlasticityStressUpdate?\nThanks,\nBala",
