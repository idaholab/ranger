          "bodyText": "I have two input files below that are a minimal working example of an error I am running into. The error occurs with multiapp restoring. I am a child multiapp that changes the subdomain depending on the current location of the parent multiapp. I have a block restricted auxvariable and auxkernel that changes based on a CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier. This is causing the restoring problem. The restore will hang on me for hours even with small meshes until I stop it, so I can't get a backtrace. Using a debugger, I found that within Multiapp.C line 627 the restore is called and it seems to get hung up at SystemBase.C  at line 94 within that for loop. All that occurs in the terminal is\n\"Restoring Application............................................................................\" with the dots ever increasing.

What I then need to do is to multiply the field (Hx,Hy,Hz) with a time dependence that cannot be parameterized but is read into a PiecewiseMultilinearfunction that is used to define an auxiliary variable \"coil_current\". What I'd like to do is then to use an AuxKernel that multiplies \"coil_current\" (which is the value of a current given by times t from the PiecewiseMultilinear function) with the field (Hx,Hy,Hz) to get a field time-dependent field (Hext_x_time, Hext_y_time,Hext_z_time). I am not sure about the syntax in the AuxKernel. Right now I have\n[AuxKernels]\n[./Hext_x_time]\ntype = FunctionAux\nvariable = Hext_x\nfunction = 'coil_current*node_Hx'\n[../]\nand similarly for the y and z components. But this is not working (garbled syntax, I think). What is the correct syntax for multiplying together a time-dependent variable (coil_current) with a function (node_Hx)?\nThanks,\nOlle",

If the conditioning is decent, PETSc has generally no trouble solving the linear problems.\nIf you want to test if you implemented the PDE right you need to perform a verification procedure.\nI ll paste here @hugary1995 's excellent suggestions from another post:\n In FEM code, typically two methods are used for the verification stage in code development\n\nPatch test: You'll need to setup a problem that is as simple as possible in which the analytical solution is known, and the solution can\nbe exactly matched by the basis function of your choice. For example, you can create a single-element cube, apply Dirichlet BC on\n one side, and apply Neumann BC on the opposite side. By applying your kernels one at a time, you can easily match the numerical\n solution (given by MOOSE) with the analytical solution.\n\nMethod of manufactured solution: This method is documented here https://mooseframework.inl.gov/python/mms.html. In essence, you\n will first manufacture an arbitrary, non-homogeneous solution, and then work your way back to derive the corresponding \"body force\"\n that would result in the manufactured solution. Even if the manufactured solution can't be exactly represented on the basis function\n of your choice, you should still see optimal order of convergence by looking at the appropriate error measure.\n\nAnother concern is whether you implemented the jacobian right (did you use AD? If so dont worry about that part).\nThis page has resources for checking this:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/development/analyze_jacobian.html",

Yeah, this is an odd one -- the MetaPhysicL exception is only thrown when the mesh gets large...\nThe only possibility I can think of is when your mesh gets more refined, the temperature and porosity variables get more resolution, and at certain quadrature point their values trigger the MetaPhysicL exception. You probably have log of a negative number or something like that somewhere in your material. Does that ring a bell?",
