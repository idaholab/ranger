          "bodyText": "Hi :)\nI was wondering if there is a way with the existing MeshGenerators to generate a lower dimensional block from a list of points (x,y,z) that describe a polyline and add this to an existing 3D filemesh. The polyline in my case is also following the edges of the filemesh.\nMy question is similar to this one #24174\nBut my filemesh (exodus format) is not coming from GMSH.\nIf this isnt possible does someone know a way/tool to do this?\nCheers\nFlorian",

And I wanted to only have the edges.\nAnd the new block should be connected to the 3D mesh along all nodes it shares.\nFor more context, in a hydraulic simulation (Darcy, porous flow, GOLEM application containing the physics) the 1D block should represent a highly conductive structure (a well) that can exchange fluid flow with the surrounding 3D-mesh-elements.

In libMesh and MOOSE you can take e.g. an Edge2 and give it one Lagrange or Hierarchic variable for continuous Galerkin heat conduction or one Hermite variable for conduction or phase field evolution or three Lagrange variables for displacement or multi-species conduction or 6 for displacements and moments or whatever, and it's still an Edge2, but in some other codes the \"element type\" refers to each unique combination of geometry and discretization (including degree) and physics.",

Something tells me there is an issue with Conda and Mamba, and my shell configuration, but I cannot get my hands around it. For example, radon has been working fine since August and last week I added ExampleConvection to it and opened a new shell and this the error I got. So I made xenon, a fresh MOOSE install and new app, and still got the same error. What does the error mean?\nI am willing to try anything let me know thx!\nJohn Sevic",

I'm a Linux person, and on any distribution with a package manager you'll have cstdlib brought in by mandatory dependencies: e.g. apt install g++ brings in g++-12 which brings in libstdc++-12-dev which installs /usr/include/c++/12/cstdlib.\nOn my Macbook from locate cstdlib I'm seeing versions in  /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1, as well as in 4 or 5 different conda packages.  Running clang++ -E -x c++ - -v with any installed clang++ shows one of those places hard-coded into the compiler, as it's supposed to be.\n@jsevic, what do the locate cstdlib and clang++ -E -x c++ - -v (assuming that's the compiler you're using) commands say for you?",

We currently have issues with extending our 2D CZM model into 3D due to memory constraints (limit in duplicated mesh)\nI have found the following GitHub Discussion Issue page:  #12033\nThere is a discussion between Cody and Andrea about Pre-split mesh option to achieve distributed mesh functionality. I find it quite interesting and did a simple test in local. It seems like the interface information is saved correctly but no variables is updated at each save (as exodus file).\nI wonder if this option is still in progress or it is due to my misunderstanding about the process.

I would expect a pressure profile given by -rho * g * y, but it looks like the solution found in steady state is slightly different. Why is that? Perhaps there is some physics I am missing? (see temp_grav_test_s.i)\nThen, I modify the BCs to have flux from left to right with Dirichlet BCs. The temperature is fixed at the left, and 'PorousFlowOutflowBC' at the right allows free outflow of temperature. It seems to work fine for pore pressure, but the temperature diverges. Note that this works fine without gravity. Why is that? (see temp_grav_test.i)\nFinally, I would like to implement 'PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink' to model flow and temperature instead of Dirichlet BCs. How can I set up these boundaries in the case of temperature? Something like this, maybe?\n  [in_left]\n    type = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\n    variable = porepressure\n    boundary = 'left'\n    pt_vals = '-1e9 1e9' # x coordinates defining g\n    multipliers = '-1e9 1e9' # y coordinates defining g\n    PT_shift = 2.E6   # BC pressure\n    flux_function = 1E-5 # Variable C\n    fluid_phase = 0\n  []\n\n  [in_left_temp]\n    type = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\n    variable = temperature\n    boundary = 'left'\n    pt_vals = '-1e9 1e9' # x coordinates defining g\n    multipliers = '-1e9 1e9' # y coordinates defining g\n    PT_shift = 280   # BC temperature\n    flux_function = 1E-5 # Variable C\n    fluid_phase = 0\n  []\n\nTo the models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KY9KZ558KDBJsSsjcUQEHvs1R0v5FTed?usp=drive_link\nEdit:\nLink to the github repos: https://github.com/burritotukituki/PorousFlowStuff\nMany thanks in advance!\nTukituki",

In my current simulation setup, I am utilizing the PorousFlowPolyLineSink method to control fluid flux rather. Specifically, I have employed PorousFlowPolyLineSink for managing pore pressure, while I have imposed fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions for temperature. I am seeking your advice on whether this is the most appropriate approach.\nHowever, I have encountered an issue when attempting to implement PorousFlowPolyLineSink in conjunction with temperature. It appears that my simulation diverges in this configuration, as exemplified below:\n  [DiracKernels]  \n  [heat_in]\n        type = PorousFlowPolyLineSink\n        SumQuantityUO = source_hot_heat\n        fluxes = -1\n        p_or_t_vals = 0.0\n        line_length = 10.0\n        multiplying_var = temp\n        use_enthalpy = true\n        point_file = inj.bh\n        variable = temperature\n    []\n[]\n\n  [AuxVariables]\n    [temp]\n      initial_condition = 293\n    []\n[]\n\nAny suggestions of how can I set this polyline?",
