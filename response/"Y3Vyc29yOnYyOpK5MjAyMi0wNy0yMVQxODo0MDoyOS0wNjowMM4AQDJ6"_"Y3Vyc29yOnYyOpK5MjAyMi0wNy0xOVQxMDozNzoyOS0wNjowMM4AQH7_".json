          "bodyText": "Hi there. I used the times operator to perform the tensor product shown in image below. Since 2 of the indices are repeated, the rank of the result (tau) should be a RankTwoTensor, but it outputs RankFourTensor. I was wondering if there is another way to perform this operation or convert the RankFour to RankTwo? I put part of the code and the equation below for more information.\nTauE1_3d_c(dv, nel, db, &intb, &vol); //db is a RankTwoTensor\nRankFourTensor C = dpk1dF_e[qp];\nusingTensorIndices(i , j , m_ , n_ );\nconst RankFourTensor tau = db.times<i_,j_,m_,i_,n_,j_>(C);\n\nThanks,\nAmir",

We don't have an example that does exactly this in the repo, so I think the easiest thing to do would be to adapt one of the existing examples that simulates two-phase coexistence and modify it. We have a couple examples where you have an order parameter representing the phase and a single composition variable. In these cases, there is two-phase coexistence as dictated by the common tangent construction between the two phase free energies. I guess the simplest thing to do would be to add a constant offset to the intermetallic phase free energy so that it is always above the random solid solution phase free energy, so that dissolution of the intermetallic phase would be energetically favorable. I'd suggest trying this out with simple parabolic free energies before moving to Calphad-based functions; try doing two-phase coexistence, make sure you get the equilibrium compositions you expect first then add an offset to force dissolution.\nI think the best starting places would be: for a WBM-type phase-field model, there is a test you could modify:\nmoose/modules/phase_field/test/tests/MultiPhase/derivativetwophasematerial.i\nand you can see the documentation for this type of model here:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/materials/DerivativeTwoPhaseMaterial.html#!\nThere are some tweaks to this test if you want to use it for a physical system, such as increasing mesh resolution; let's discuss further if you want to go this route.\nFor a KKS-type of phase field model, you could start from\nmoose/modules/phase_field/examples/kim-kim-suzuki/kks_example_noflux.i\nThis is a 1D example but the parameters are maybe a little closer to simulating a physical system. You can find documentation on the KKS models here:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/phase_field/MultiPhase/KKS.html",

I'd like to know the value of stress at the tip of the pyramid as it is pressed into the material puck. I was thinking I could use a parsed function to determine the point as it changes position and feed that to the PointValue PostProcessor, I have not been successful. Is this the correct way to go about getting this value? Or is there a better option?\nHere is a small section of my input which I am currently tinkering with. This does not work, however, it displays the logic which I am trying to achieve.\n[Functions]\n[point_value]\ntype = ParsedFunction\nvalue = '0-t'\n[]\n[]\n[PostProcessors]\n[strss_zz_tip]\ntype = PointValue\nvariable = stress_zz\npoint = ' 0 point_value 12.5'\nblock = 1\n[]\n[]\nThank you.",

You may use the Controls system to do that, to execute it exactly when you want to. This would be done in a single calculation/single input file approach.\n\nOR\n\nwrite all the necessary data (all field variables etc) to a restart file, either exodus or checkpoint. Then you will NOT be able to restart directly, but you may restart this data in a MultiApp executed on INITIAL with the original mesh then move the data over using transfers (which will take care of projections). This is a little obnoxious but our only work around for the element renumbering that would occur during remeshing\n\nNote: If you are ONLY doing smoothing and the elements are the same, you may consider restarting directly\nIn the future (eg some time next FY) we will be able run mesh generators during a calculation.\nGuillaume",
