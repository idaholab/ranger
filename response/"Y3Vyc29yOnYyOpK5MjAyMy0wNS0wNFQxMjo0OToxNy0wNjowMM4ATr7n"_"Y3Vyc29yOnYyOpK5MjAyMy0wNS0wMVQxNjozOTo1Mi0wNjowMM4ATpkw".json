In order to solve the equation, I have to custom(make) a kernel for myself or use a kernel that has been already made and used.\n\nSo, there are two variables V(voltage), and T(temperature).\nMaybe, I can use the HeatConductionTimeDerivative, HeatConduction, JouleHeatingSource, and MatDiffusion kernels to solve the equation.\nThe problem is the -sigma*del(V)*del(pi) term.\nIs there any kernel that the Moose provides? Should I make a new one for myself?\nIn addition, if I have wrong thinking or derivative formula, please feel free to tell me.\nFor your information, another equation is -sigma*del^2(V)=0; a current continuity equation that has no time derivative.",

In the CentralDifference.h, we have the following code snippet for evaluating  u_dot and  u_dotdot:\ntemplate <typename T, typename T2, typename T3, typename T4, typename T5>\nvoid\nCentralDifference::computeTimeDerivativeHelper(T & u_dot,\n                                               T2 & u_dotdot,\n                                               const T3 & u_old,\n                                               const T4 & u_old_old,\n                                               const T5 & u_old_old_old) const\n{\n  // computing first derivative\n  // using the Central Difference method\n  // u_dot_old = (first_term - second_term) / 2 / dt\n  //       first_term = u\n  //      second_term = u_older\n  u_dot = u_old;\n  u_dot -= u_old_old_old; // 'older than older' solution\n  u_dot *= 1.0 / (2.0 * _dt);\n\n  // computing second derivative\n  // using the Central Difference method\n  // u_dotdot_old = (first_term - second_term + third_term) / dt / dt\n  //       first_term = u\n  //      second_term = 2 * u_old\n  //       third_term = u_older\n  u_dotdot = u_old;\n  u_dotdot -= u_old_old;\n  u_dotdot -= u_old_old;\n  u_dotdot += u_old_old_old;\n  u_dotdot *= 1.0 / (_dt * _dt);\n}\n\nHowever, the u_old is extracted from _solution_old which is the solution from previous time step (?), say n, that makes the evaluation as follows:\n$$ \\dot{u_{n-1}} = \\frac{u_n - u_{n-2}}{\\Delta t} $$\n$$\\ddot{u_{n-1}} =  \\frac{u_n - 2u_{n-1} + u_{n-2}}{\\Delta t^2} $$\nThis is different from the equation on website page https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/timeintegrators/CentralDifference.html. I expect given the weak from with inertia term $\\rho \\ddot{u}$, the $\\ddot{u}$ would first express as terms with $u_{n+1}, u_{n}, u_{n-1}$ and we solve for $u_{n+1}$, but it seems like here we get $\\ddot{u}$ directly through previous values and fit it into the weak form?
