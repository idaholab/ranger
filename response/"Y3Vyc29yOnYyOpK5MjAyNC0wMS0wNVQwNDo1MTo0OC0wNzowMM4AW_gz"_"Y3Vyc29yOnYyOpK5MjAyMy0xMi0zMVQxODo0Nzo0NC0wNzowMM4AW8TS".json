Libraries got update without any error including those from 'moose-dev'. But while building the moose in 'opt' mode, I got the similar error as reported in  #26433 . i.e.,\nerror: 'class wasp::HITNodeView' has no member named 'token_type'; did you mean 'set_type'?\n  687 |     auto token_type = value_node.token_type();\n      |                                  ^~~~~~~~~~\n      |                                  set_type\n\nThen I tried to update 'WASP' by './scripts/update_and_rebuild_wasp.sh'.

If it s not recovering by itself, and removing the package is not enough, do you have the option to uninstall conda and try again from scratch?\n\nGuillaume\n\n-\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<#26460 (comment)>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACMWYUGLUB45H5STM4TVVOTYMSJNNAVCNFSM6AAAAABBKVIS6GVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43SRDJONRXK43TNFXW4Q3PNVWWK3TUHM3TSOJXHEZDC>.\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID: ***@***.***>",

The predictor takes in the initial guess at the beginning of each time step then predicts a new solution and uses that as the initial guess.\nTo see if my predictor is working well, I would ideally like to calculate the residual using both the original initial guess for the timestep, along with my new vector, so I would be calculating the residual using two different vectors.\nMy question is if there is any functionality in MOOSE that already exists to do this, or would I have to take an approach similar to that in ArrayDiffsusion.C (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/variables/ArrayMooseVariable.html) where they wrote in the governing equation and solved there.\nThat would be fine to do, but I was just wondering if you all had an internal method to do this already made or if there was another good example to look at for how to do this.\nThanks you!\nCharlie",

Following the installation of MOOSE on the cluster, including PETSc, libMesh, and WASP components, I successfully built and tested MOOSE as per the provided instructions. The tests concluded with 3839 passed, 367 skipped, 0 pending, and 0 failed. Subsequently, I proceeded to create an application named \"precipitation\" (refer to the attached picture). After initial successful make and test operations, I modified the MakeFile, changing \"All Module\" to \"Yes.\" However, this adjustment did not yield the expected results. It seems that only one test was rechecked instead of the anticipated comprehensive check of multiple tests.\nI suspect there might be an issue with the testing process or the MakeFile configuration. Could you kindly provide insights into what might be causing this discrepancy and guide me on resolving the problem?\nMany thanks in advance for your kind support,\nSajjad\nPS: I tested both make -j 6 and make -j 1 while creating and testing, and the results were same.",

The only question is whether it will be robust enough to finish your transient through any phase disappearance (zero volume fraction). As far as why RELAP5 has been more successful in this area (I'm assuming this is the case anyway), I don't think it's necessarily 6-equation vs. 7-equation - I think it's just a better phase disappearance treatment. I think that both 6-equation and 7-equation models must treat phase disappearance in some way. I would say it may be not just a function of the flow model but also of the fluid property calculations robustness.\nAs for references, I would just see what comes up when you google \"RELAP-7\". I don't know that it's worth the effort of reading everything - just know that some accidents may succeed and some may fail due to phase disappearance robustness issues - it all depends on your problem.",

By the way, I also have other questions (I developed the six-equation model):\n\nwhat the variables of six-equation model should be? [\u03b1, p, ul, ug, Tl, Tg] or [(\u03b1\u03c1)l, (\u03b1\u03c1)g, (\u03b1\u03c1u)l, (\u03b1\u03c1u)g, (\u03b1\u03c1E)l, (\u03b1\u03c1E)g]? I know the former form is for incompressiable flow, and the later is for compressiable flow. Two-phase flow sometime is incompressiable(\u03b1=0), but sometimes it is compressiable(\u03b1=1). Which one should I choose?\nIf \u03b1=0 or \u03b1=1, the 6-equation would become to 3-equation, which could cause non-convergence for NAN. Now, I just constrain the \u03b1min = 1.0e-4 and \u03b1max = 0.9999 to always use 6-equation. Is it correct?\nwhich fluid properties does RELAP7 use? Water97FluidProperty? Now, I use IAPWS-IF97. But it is a problem when it is single-phase. For example, when it is liquid (\u03b1 <= \u03b1min), should the vapour properties be liquid? If yes, the properties will change rapidly causing divergence. Now, I also constrain the properties using the variable p and Tsat+0.0001 to make sure they are always vapour properties.\nFor the convection terms in 6-equation, I use roe-type numerical scheme and DG kernel, just like THM. But it just calculate convection term. The momentum equations of six-equation model have the terms in red circle. How to solve this term? Now, I just put it in Material using (\u03b1i+1 - \u03b1i)/xi+1 - xi. Is it correct? Is there any better way?\n\n\nThank you very much! I'm so sorry I have so many questions.....",

We chose the latter set for the 7-equation model, but I've been wondering if we should additionally implement the former. In terms of the formulation, it does not matter, but I do believe it may have an impact on the numerics, perhaps the conditioning of your Jacobian dF/dU. You say alpha=0 and alpha=1 are related to compressibility? I don't understand that - it just determines which phase is present.\nYou can try that strategy. We certainly have, and it was not a silver bullet. Maybe it'll work out for you.\nTypically we used the 1995 water formulation in RELAP-7. We could use the 1997 formulation if all of the necessary interfaces were implemented. And your questions indicate the tricky question - what happens to the vanished phase? A good question that we don't quite have the answer to. We have some relaxation terms that would keep that phase around saturation conditions of the other phase. That may work.\nThe 7-equation model has similar terms but uses the interfacial pressure instead. That term becomes a non-conservative contribution to our inter-cell flux vector, so it is treated in a similar manner as the advective terms. Otherwise you could try it as a volumetric term if you're able to produce some approximation like you've suggested within the cell volume.\n\nIn general, and I cannot speak for everyone on the MOOSE team, but we don't have all of the answers to the questions of what's best for a two-phase flow formulation. We only know what we attempted, and we did not have the time and funding to produce a formulation that was entirely satisfactory, so I'd suggest you do some research into the methodology from a literature review. What we can definitely help you with is the implementation in MOOSE. The rest of the help we give you may be questionable.",

In this case, it is incompressible. On the other hand, if \u03b1g = 1, it is pure vapour, which means it is compressible. As you said, the formulation has impact on the numerics, so which formulation is better for the two-phase six-equation model?\nCould you please kindly tell me the strategy you used? or could you give me some reference? I think my strategy is not very good.\nFor the properties, I noticed RELAP7 also has the stiffened gas equation of state (SGEOS). Does it work? Although SGEOS is not accurate enough, I think it does not have the same problem, like IF-97.\nwhen you treat this term, do you use the numerical scheme, like HLLC or something else? Additionally, If we treat this term in the similar manner, it is necessary to implement an additional boundary condition, what the boundary flux should be? (flux_advective + p*flux_alpha) * _normal * _test[_i][_qp]?\n\nThank you very much. These issues will not be encountered unless we are truly writing these codes.

It's a little convoluted but this is not going to be very expensive to do.\n\nOnce you have created the mapping, you can cache it if you care about performance\nGuillaume",

In this model, I divide the mechanical quantity by $\\Delta f$(about 10E9) and this might result in the yield stress is not consistent with others. I will check the consistency of units, whilst I have tried a few different parameter combinations, and they did not work. So, I worried about whether my idea is right. Do you have any advice or examples about applying inelastic deformation into phase field models? Thank you very much.",
