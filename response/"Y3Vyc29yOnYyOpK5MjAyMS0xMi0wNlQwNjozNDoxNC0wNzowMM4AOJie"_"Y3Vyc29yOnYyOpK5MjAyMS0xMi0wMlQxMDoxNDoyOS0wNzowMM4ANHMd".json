This can be done in parallel, and is done by launching your python script with mpi4py. The issue here, is that since the MOOSE application doesnt initialise MPI, there is already an a running MPI initialised, and doesnt seem to play nicely. My runs are short, and thus MOOSE doesn't need to run in parallel.",

If possible, I would like to auto-generate variables for all of these species and have an expectation that they exist within every block. Recently, I explored using Actions to auto-generate these variables for all of these species and I think I was able to do this successfully.\nThe first issue I have is that I am not sure how to connect kernels to these auto-generated variables. Furthermore, I have situations in which one species type can transform into one of the other species types. How would I go about accessing those auto-generated variables from within an interface?\nAt the end of the day, this effort (should I be successful) will result in a drastic simplification to the model inputs. Fundamentally, I suspect the MOOSE framework is likely capable of accomplishing the workflow I am intending, however I am not experienced enough to know how to approach this.\nI do apologize if my questions here have been overly vague, but I very much appreciate any assistance you can provide.\nMany thanks,\n~Mike",
