When i want to start a test simulation which works perfectly on other machines I have but with older Moose versions (e.g. git commit d89c423 on 2023-05-04) I get an error related to PETSC.\nPETSC ERROR: Incompatible vector local lengths parameter # 1 local size 76570 != parameter # 2 local size 76215\nSee full terminal output below.\nAny idea what is causing this?\nCheers\nFlorian\npetsc_libmesh_error.txt",

          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm currently trying to run several hundred relatively small simulations on INL's Sawtooth cluster, but I'm having an issue. The study I'm doing required me to modify some source code, so I did a custom install following the instructions on mooseframework.inl.gov. But the simulations are running incredibly slowly. A simulation that takes ~4 hours on my laptop had not finished after 7 days on the cluster (1 CPU in each case).\nI wanted to test whether it was my installation or my PBS job script, so I timed running the tests in moose/test/ on my laptop (1 CPU) and Sawtooth (8 CPUs). My laptop took 16 minutes and Sawtooth took 40 minutes.\nDoes anyone have any advice/tips to get MOOSE to run faster on Sawtooth?",

The only caveat is that it s not backed up so please make sure to save your results to home every now and then.\nGuillaume",

The boundary conditions is setting an initial velocity of the cylinder in positive y direction and study its response of impact on the block. Primary surface is the block bottom edge, and secondary surface is the upper 3/4 perimeter of the circle. I am using 1st order quad elements with volumetric locking.\n\nMy question is, sometimes the mortar method leads to penetration of the circle into the block.\nfor Mortar method the end time of the simulation\n\nbut for penalty this issue is gone for same input file and at same end time\n\nwhen I plot the penetration, I think the penetration is detected correctly with a positive number in the corners. What are some possible reasons for this issue, any advice is appreciated! The input file block is\n  [Mesh]\n    patch_update_strategy = always\n    patch_size = 10\n    #partitioner = centroid\n    #centroid_partitioner_direction = y\n  \n    [simple_mesh]\n      type = FileMeshGenerator\n      file = saph_al_r10_finesphquad.msh\n    []\n  \n  \n    # For NodalVariableValue to work with distributed mesh\n    allow_renumbering = false\n  [../]\n\n  [Contact]\n    [mechanical]\n      formulation = mortar\n      model = frictionless\n      primary = 'block_bottom'\n      secondary = 'sphere_up'\n      c_normal = 1.0e3\n      normalize_c=true\n      mortar_dynamics = true\n      newmark_beta = 0.25\n      newmark_gamma = 0.5\n\n    []\n  []\n\nfor penalty the contact block is\n  [Contact]\n    [mechanical]\n      formulation = penalty\n      model = frictionless\n      primary = 'block_bottom'\n      secondary = 'sphere_up'\n      penalty=1e3\n[]\n[]",

The penalty formulation will not contain any dynamics treatment, so there's a slight apples and oranges comparison here.

It can be related to the dynamics enforcement. There is another parameter to define, i.e. the capture tolerance. I have never run a dynamics problem with such large deformation, so I am very interested in this: @laimaster21 can you attach the entire input file and mesh that yield the problematic results?",

The two meshes are completely overlapping. As I mentioned, you need to translate them to make the interfaces match.\nThis answers this question:\n\nWhy are the dimensions not adding up in the horizontal axis?\n\nI dont think the stitcher is meant to be used with overlapping meshes.

Is it a natural or obvious thing?\nIf something is wrong, how do I avoid this in Moose?\nIn my opinion, solving two different equations self-consistently(when one converges and then the other one is started to solve) is a good option if it is possible in the Moose.\nFor your information, I attached my input file below (actually solving three different equations).\n########## Global Parameters ########## \nxmax = 35\nymax = 20\n#######################################\n\n\n\n[Mesh]\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n  dim = 2\n  nx = 35\n  ny = 60\n  nz = 0\n  xmin = 0\n  xmax = ${xmax}\n  ymin = 0\n  ymax = ${ymax}\n  zmin = 0\n  zmax = 0\n  elem_type = QUAD8\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n  [./bc_func]\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    data_file = './vsweep.csv'\n    format = columns\n    scale_factor = 1.0\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [./N]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n  [../]\n\n  [./V]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    initial_condition = 0.0\n  [../]\n\n  [./T]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    initial_condition = 300.0\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [./N_IC]\n    type = MultiBoundingBoxIC\n    corners = '0.0 0.0 0   '\n    opposite_corners = '9.0 20.0 0'\n    inside = '1.2'\n    outside = 0.0\n    variable = N\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [V_top]\n    type = FunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = V\n    function = bc_func # GND\n    boundary = 'top'\n  []\n\n  [V_bot]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = V\n    value = 0.0\n    boundary = 'bottom'\n  []\n\n  [./T_top]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = top\n    variable = T\n    value = 300 #in K\n  [../]\n\n  [./T_bot]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = bottom\n    variable = T\n    value = 300 #in K\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n\n  ########### Phase-field ############\n\n  [./Matdiff_D_del2_N]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = N\n    diffusivity = Diff_coeff\n  [../]\n\n  [./Matdiff_N_del2_V]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = V\n    diffusivity = eDkT_times_N\n  [../]\n\n  [./TJHS_del_N_del_V]\n    type = ThermalJouleHeatingSource\n    variable = N\n    elec = V\n    electrical_conductivity = eDkT\n    Seebeck_coefficient = 1\n  []\n\n  [./PFM_time]\n    type = TimeDerivative\n    variable = N\n  [../]\n\n  ########## Phase-field END ##########\n\n  ########## Electrical ###############\n\n  [./Matdiff_sig_del2_V]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = V\n    diffusivity = 'electrical_conductivity'\n  [../]\n\n  ########## Electrical END ###########\n\n  ###### Heat ######\n\n  [./HeatDiff]\n    type = HeatConduction\n    variable = T\n  [../]\n\n#  [./HeatTdot]\n#    type = HeatConductionTimeDerivative\n#    variable = T\n#  [../]\n\n  [./HeatSrc]\n    type = JouleHeatingSource\n    variable = T\n    elec = V\n  [../]\n\n  ##################\n\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [./Diff_coeff]\n    type = ParsedMaterial\n    property_name  = Diff_coeff\n    coupled_variables = 'T'\n    constant_names       = 'D0      E_A_D    kB        ' #[nm^2/s] [eV]  [eV/K]\n    constant_expressions = '2e+11   1.0      8.617e-5'\n    expression = 'D0*exp(-E_A_D/(kB*T))' #[nm^2/s]\n    outputs = exodus\n  [../]\n\n  [./eDkT_times_N]\n    type = ParsedMaterial\n    property_name = eDkT_times_N\n    coupled_variables = 'N  T'\n    constant_names       = 'kB        ' #[V/K]  [K]\n    constant_expressions = '8.617e-5'\n    material_property_names = 'Diff_coeff'\n    expression = 'Diff_coeff/(kB*T)*N' #[1/(s*V*nm)]\n    outputs = exodus\n  [../]\n\n  [./eDkT]\n    type = ParsedMaterial\n    property_name = eDkT\n    coupled_variables = 'T'\n    constant_names       = 'kB       ' #[V/K]\n    constant_expressions = '8.617e-5'\n    material_property_names = 'Diff_coeff'\n    expression = 'Diff_coeff/(kB*T)' #[nm^2/(s*V)]\n    outputs = exodus\n  [../]\n\n  [./electrical_conductivity_INS]\n    type = ParsedMaterial\n    coupled_variables = 'N E_AC_elec T'\n    property_name = 'electrical_conductivity'\n    constant_names =        'sig_H    sig_L     kB'       \n    constant_expressions =  '1.0e-6   2.860e-4  8.617' #[1/(ohm*nm)] [1/(ohm*nm)] [eV/K]\n#    material_property_names = 'h'\n#    function = '(1/cm_2_nm) * if(eta <= 0.5-w/2,Crys,if(eta<0.5+w/2, Amor + 0.5*(Crys+Amor)*(1.0+cos(pi*(eta-0.5+w/2)/w)),Amor))'  # [1/(ohm*nm)]\n#    function = '(sig_L -

You can verify that yourself by moving some variables from [Variables] to constant [AuxVariables] and checking the equations one by one.\nI think that's the next step for you here. Making sure each equation is correct, tackling one at a time.\nPlease keep in mind that variable = in a kernel is both:\n\na way to indicate the equation that the kernel is part of\na way to indicate which variable the kernel acts on, but sometimes, for example for this object, you can make it act on another variable using a v parameter\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/ADCoupledTimeDerivative.html\n\nGuillaume",
