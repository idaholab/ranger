          "bodyText": "Hello,\nMy goal is to perform PDE-constrained optimization, and I am using MOOSE to perform the simulations. In addition to the simulation result, I would like to compute the solution of the 'Tangent Linear System' using MOOSE. A short explanation for what I would like to do:\nMy PDE: F (T,v) = 0\nT : state variable\nv : control variable (real number)\nTangent linear system: [dF(T,v) / dT] * x = - [dF(T,v) / dv] ; linear solve for x\nThe matrix dF(T,v) / dT is the jacobian of the original PDE. I would like to know if I can modify the executioner (or other appropriate object) so that the tangent linear system can be solved right after the \"original\" MOOSE solve in a single run of the simulation.\nI am aware that MOOSE can perform matrix-free solves, but for my problem I am using a NEWTON solve.\nThanks in advance!\nKind regards,\nNikhil",

                  "bodyText": "Yes. You can modify executioners in whatever way. Once you have [dF(T,v) / dT] and [dF(T,v) / dv], you can directly use PETSc to solve for x. If dF(T,v) / dT is fixed in this solve, you do not have to use MOOSE's PJFNK machinery which could be messy with your \"original\" system. I feel you can evaluate dF(T,v) / dv pretty easily with MOOSE residual evaluation and Control for v. Just my suggestions.",

Anyway, modernising the input file isn't hard and doesn't make any difference to the result in this case.\nThe overall point is: you have converged! The solution is found, to the precision available on your computer.\nYou can probably squeeze better precision from the problem by\n\naltering the permeability (the steady-state doesn't depend on perm in this case) or elasticity tensor , since these things are so small/big that they result in bad precision loss\npaying particular attention to scaling (eg, perhaps set scaling = 1E-6 for the disp_r and disp_z terms, and don't use automatic_scaling)\nperhaps some flags in the Kernels (eg full_upwind_threshold and fallback_scheme)\n\nbut the result won't be much different.  If you're unhappy with the result then you'll have to muck around with the mesh (large elements obviously have different contributions to the residual than small elements), or maybe do a subsequent transient run with super long time steps (won't make much difference but might make you feel better), or similar.",

I am a student and relatively new in using MOOSE / Phase Field and have few questions for anyone able to help.\n\n\nI am trying to do a simulation for polycrystal grain growth. I saw the example that applies the polycrystalvariables and polycrystalkernel actions. I modified the polycrystalkernel action to include the following kernels: ADAllenCahn, ADTimeDerivative, and ADACInterfaceKobayashi2 for a basic simulation. My trouble comes in with the bulk free energy [gr^2 * (gr - 1)^2)] that I need to specify as a function material. I tried to write it as a derivative parsed material directly under the Materials block but since we have many order parameters set up with the polycrystalvariables action (gr0, gr1, gr2,...), the software does not recognizes the variable in the equation. I am wondering if there is a specific format in writing the equation in the input file to refer to all the parameters or if there is any specific kernel that already produces this outcome that I may have missed.\n\n\nThe bulk free energy that I am using only depends on the order parameter [gr^2 * (gr - 1)^2)] which I can use the ADAllenCahn kernel to implement. But I was wondering if there is a version of the ADAllenCahn kernel that takes into account bulk free energy equations with parameters/arguments other than the order parameter. I know the AllenCahn Kernel does that but I am asking about one that has automatic differentiation applied in .\n\n\nI attached my input file and the kernel action I am using to set up the kernels.\nfiles.zip",

But I want to point out this print is just for debugging. That being said, the option is often employed to print out a small matrix for checking if the code works correctly.\nIf you want to dump a large matrix and use it in other codes, you need to use a binary file (-ksp_view_pmat binary). In general, I do NOT think it is a good idea to dump a large matrix unless you have a strong motivation. Instead, you should directly couple MOOSE to other codes to accomplish this.",

Following your questions I have revised the input file and done modeling again.\n\nwhy don't you have a PorousFlowEffectiveStressCoupling Kernel for disp_z ?\n\n\nNow I have added, however no apparent effect for above mentioned pressure field.\n\n\nHave you checked your sidesets in your mesh? Viz, the 'left' and 'injection_area' sidesets?\n\n\n\nIt seems the 'injection area' functions. This figure shows that the pressure field during initial pressure build up (no CO2 enter into the aquifer domain). We see the pressure build up well in vertical range of the aquifer.\nThe above mentioned pressure anomaly appeared after CO2 plume migrated to upper aquifer.\n\n\nwhy are your bulk moduli so high?\n\n\nOh, I Just followed the example \"modules/porous_flow/examples/thm_example/2D.i\" without checking \ud83d\ude02. Now I have changed they to low values; however, the pressure problem remains.\n\n\nHave you checked your initial conditions?\n\n\nI specially use another run to get an hydrostatic initial conditions. Link here\n\nThe problem. Here I do not know how to inherit the initialized strain field to the following run.\n\nIn the initial run\n\n  [./strain]\n    type = ComputeAxisymmetricRZSmallStrain\n    eigenstrain_names = 'ini_stress'\n  [../]\n  [./ini_strain]\n    type = ComputeEigenstrainFromInitialStress\n    initial_stress = '-12.8E6 0 0  0 -12.8E6 0  0 0 -12.8E6'\n    eigenstrain_name = ini_stress\n  [../]\n\n\n\nIn the subsequent CO2 injection run, I commented out the \"ini_strain\" block.\n\n  [./strain]\n    type = ComputeAxisymmetricRZSmallStrain\n    # eigenstrain_names = 'ini_stress'\n  [../]\n  # [./ini_strain]\n  #   type = ComputeEigenstrainFromInitialStress\n  #   # initial_stress = '-12.8E6 0 0  0 -12.8E6 0  0 0 -12.8E6'\n  #   # eigenstrain_name = ini_stress\n  # [../]\n\n\nNow I have changed the setting in the subsequent CO2 injection run the same as the initial run.  The result seems better.\nCould tell me what is the right way for inheriting strain stress field from the initial run?\n\n\n\nAre the displacements as expected?\n\n\nThe strain field has the same problem as the pressure field.",

However, internally within MOOSE, stress is represented at the quadpoints of the element (there are 4 in each element in your case).  For the initial configuration, MOOSE finds the stresses at those quadpoints, then averages them to write to the exodus file.  Then you read those averaged versions and assign those averaged versions to each quadpoint.  Then MOOSE sees the result is not in exact equilibrium, and changes the stresses (and displacements) slightly to achieve equilibrium (so you're back at the true equilibrium situation MOOSE computed in the initial simulation).\nWhat i've done in cases like this is to create some \"change_disp\" AuxVariables that record the change in displacement after the first timestep.

If the problem is 2-phase flow related it's probably a bug in your input file, but i can't see one.)  Alternatives to what you're doing already are recover/restart (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/application_usage/restart_recover.html) or: (a) read from your steady-state; (b) do a very long-time transient without injecting to get the quadpoint stresses almost-perfect; (c) then start injecting.",
