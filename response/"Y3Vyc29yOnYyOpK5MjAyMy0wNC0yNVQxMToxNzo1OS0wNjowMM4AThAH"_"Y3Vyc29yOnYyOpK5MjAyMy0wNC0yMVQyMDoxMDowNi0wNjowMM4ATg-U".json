However, to be able to stitch the meshes I would need to define a boundary and this breaks down for 3D and 1D (cannot find a common boundary to stitch them). I also see that lowerD means (max_dim-1), but ... We routinely run simulations (based on an in-house developed mesher) with 1D-2D-3D FEMs (there is an example on the gallery page). And, yes, we use our own developed kernel for the simulations.\nThis said, would you suggest us to write our own import routine?\nThanks",

I can't recall if there are any issues with having all three dimensions present in the same mesh or not, it's possible that it already works provided that you use the \"lower_dimensional_block\" string like above.",

I am also be interested on coupled solvers (as opposed to segregated) in FVM/FEM (for the study of polydisperse multiphase flows); this is one of the strongest reasons regarding my interest in MOOSE (SNES PETSc, under the hood but more abstract interface). I mean, there are some FVM libraries on the wild, but have a rather incipient treatment of coupled solvers and don't support PETSc.\nBasically, I'd like to start with simulations using either sliding meshes (non-conformal, with non trivial topologies) or chimera (overset), if possible using INSE. I, generally, don't shy away from having to develop some code if needed but I'd like to get an idea of how much \"time\" it will require for me to get to the point I'm interested to be.\nMany thanks for the attention,\nSantiago",

                          "bodyText": "Hi @lindsayad,\nMortar couplings are a good start! For the first part of the study I have in mind \"sliding meshes\" are enough (noise propagation on a confined marine propeller). For this I don't need \"multi-mesh equation coupling\" or overset, since I'll go for classical INSE-LES and the topology of the disjoint meshes can be made non-overlapping.\n... But, down the road, I'd like to study cavitation on said propeller (polydisperse multiphase models) which is more stable when the equations are coupled (Conservation of mass becomes critical between phases, hence a segregated approach tends to \"break down\" when the dispersed n-phase approaches zero). Notice here that level-set may be used for the resolution of the bubbles.\nFinally I'd like to start adding more \"topological features\" (rudders, propellers) which are obviously \"simpler\" to mesh as disjointed, separate volume meshes.\nAt the risk of taking too much of your time, I'd like to expand a bit on the discussion we have now:\n\nMortar Methods: If I understood correctly you guys have a CHT case from which I might be able to use as \"template\" for a multi-region INSE solver.  Is that correct?\nLevel-Set: As I see in the examples, there is a PoC for level-set, however there are some suggestions on how to \"generalize\" it. is there any attempt now to build a two-phase (or multiphase) solver within DG or FVM?\nVolume-coupling (overlapping meshes, Schwartz method, Overset) and Equation coupling: Is it necessary within MOOSE to also couple the \"interpolation contribution\" onto the \"stiffness matrix\", or can it be possible to handle the \"inter-mesh\" coupling explicitely? I understand there will be an interpolation and first-order-in-time error produced there but I suspect adding the interpolation stencils onto the matrix may be quite time consuming (one might need to search the nodes/centroids both in the domain as well as in the matrix) depending how the matrix is also stored in memory (I talk as a complete newbie with MOOSE, but as an avg user of petsc in FVM).\n\nAnyway, I really thank you for taking the time to answer my questions (not very common in some FOSS CFD forums). I'll download the code and start trying it out so to get an idea on the workflow there.\nKind regards,\nSantiago",

There was no need to put two separate meshes in the same MeshBase there, though; the solid and fluid domains were just two overlapping subdomains of the same Mesh.  A few libMesh features (like feeding subdomain id sets to a PointLocator) are designed with that in mind, and IIRC Paul added some lookup caching on top of that (the PointLocatorTree is O(log N) and I guess switching to O(1) makes a difference when you're looking at every quadrature point...).  He also wrote a custom GhostingFunctor subclass to use as a coupling functor to handle the additional sparsity entries (and thereby incidentally handle the algebraic and geometric ghosting; man I'm proud of that API...).  I don't recall what he was doing for quadrature on the mismatching meshes, though.",

                  "bodyText": "Hi Ethan,\nThis is because you have 2 heat transfers attached to your flow channel, so you need to define the heat transfer coefficient material for each heat transfer (Hw:1 and Hw:2).  By default, the name of the material created by ADWallHeatTransferCoefficeint3EqnDittusBoelterMaterial  is Hw. You can change it by adding the parameter Hw to your block and specify Hw:1 or Hw:2, and also adjust the T_wall parameter to T_wall:1 and T_wall:2. Note that you will also need to create the material from the aux variable for these 2 wall temperatures. See below:\n[Hw1_mat]\n   type = ADWallHeatTransferCoefficient3EqnDittusBoelterMaterial\n   D_h = D_h\n   rho = rho\n   vel = vel\n   T = T\n   T_wall = T_wall:1\n   cp = cp\n   mu = mu\n   k = k\n  block = ${list_of_blocks_with_2_HT}\n []\n [Hw2_mat]\n   type = ADWallHeatTransferCoefficient3EqnDittusBoelterMaterial\n   D_h = D_h\n   rho = rho\n   vel = vel\n   T = T\n   T_wall = T_wall:2\n   cp = cp\n   mu = mu\n   k = k\n  block = ${list_of_blocks_with_2_HT}\n []\n\n[T_wall1_mat]\n type = ADCoupledVariableValueMaterial\n prop_name = T_wall:1\n coupled_variable = T_wall:1\n block = ${list_of_blocks_with_2_HT}\n[]\n\n[T_wall2_mat]\n type = ADCoupledVariableValueMaterial\n prop_name = T_wall:2\n coupled_variable = T_wall:2\n block = ${list_of_blocks_with_2_HT}\n[]",
