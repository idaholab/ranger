Then run:\ngit clean -xfd\nin the moose directory. This will clean up libraries, test output, and other miscellaneous objects used during building. After that, I would clean out the libmesh submodule. Perform these commands within your moose directory:\ngit submodule deinit -f libmesh\ngit submodule update --init --recursive libmesh\n\nThis will clear out the libmesh directory and pull a fresh copy of the submodule. You can do the same thing with petsc (just switch out petsc for libmesh in these command and you can remove --recursive).\nFinally, you can navigate to test and run make clobberall. This performs much the same function as git clean, but specifically focuses on the libraries and objects made during build. I find it useful to run this just in case the git clean missed something. With all that done, you should be free to rebuild petsc, libmesh, and moose.",

I believe it was an upgrade of my system where python went from 3.7 to 3.8 that caused the problem. I will make sure to clean up before rebuilding MOOSE next time.\nOn the incompatible command matter. There are two libX11.so built on my system; 32 and 64 bit:\n\n\n->  file /usr/lib64/libX11.so.6.4.0\n/usr/lib64/libX11.so.6.4.0: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped\n\n\n->  file /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.4.0\n/usr/lib/libX11.so.6.4.0: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped\n\n\nThe config script is probably probing all libX11 and finding that the 32bit version is incompatible. Just my guess. Apparently this is what is happening with a build of VisIt that I have been struggling with. The build_script does not find libX11. The fact that I saw the warning when building MOOSE gave me the hint for a related problem with VisIt.\nThanks.",

This has one solution variable and a couple of auxiliary variables.\nWithout the use of automatic_scaling, the initial residual is massive and reduces easily with Newton iterations. However, when I use automatic_scaling (as used when solving the coupled problems I am working on) the initial nonlinear residual is very small (in the order of e-18) and is assumed to have already converged according to the nl_rel_tol = nl_abs_tol = 1.0e-8.\nIs there any reason why automatic_scaling would not work on a problem with a single variable? Is it something to do with the auxiliary variables? I am only concerned that when used in the coupled problem with automatic_scaling, the residual for this variable isn't reducing sufficiently to solve the problem correctly. Is the solution to set a lower absolute tolerance on the nonlinear residuals?\nIf you require/desire the input file, please let me know and I can provide this.\nAs always, any help is greatly appreciated!\nKind regards,\nRoss.",

If so are you using preset or not? I would highly recommend using preset Dirichlet conditions if you have Dirichlet conditions.\nAnyway one way to ensure that your problem is truly converged is to use ReferenceResidualProblem. Please see this page for more documentation about it.\nMy first suggestion would be to just try ReferenceResidualProblem and see what happens. If you are unable to converge with nl_rel_tol = 1e-8 (remember to remove nl_abs_tol) perhaps because the initial residual is still too \"low\", I would try adding resid_vs_jac_scaling_param = 0.5 to your Executioner block. Doing that will ensure that both residual and Jacobian information is considered when determining the scaling factor. See the NonlinearSystemBase for more information. I would also recommend adding verbose = true to your Executioner block just to see what the scaling factor being computed is, both for the default automatic scaling setting and with the added resid_vs_jac_scaling_param = 0.5 parameter.\nIf you still have issues, please feel free to attach your input file here.",

In the simplified problem, I just have grad(mu)=0 on both boundaries and letting a linear chemical potential profile relax. This will be important towards the end of this post as it is similar to the case with no BCs applied in the mechanical case.\nReferenceResidualProblem is also very useful to know about for when I am using other physics in a coupled model. I'm glad I asked about this now. Thanks for that.\nSo, having tried removing the nl_abs_tol, it seems to work. I think the main issue was the use of nl_abs_tol=1e-8 as the 1D problem only has a single solution variable (so it wasn't other residuals dominating the problem) and there are no fluxes applied on the boundaries (so using the integration of the fluxes instead of the initial residual is probably not useful). When scaled, the initial residual was lower than 1e-8. I think when unscaled, it just wasn't lower than the absolute tolerance and was converging because of the nl_rel_tol. The standard scaling factor was 2.04503e-26 (so you can imagine how even an initial residual of 1e+9 could be small enough to have \"converged\" when only using automatic_scaling=true and nl_abs_tol=1e-8). When I used resid_vs_jac_scaling_param = 0.5, it's only scaled by 9.99547e-18. While this doesn't solve the problem if nl_abs_tol=1e-8, I think this is a better solution moving forward since, as you say, it takes into account the size of the residual and the Jacobian entries.\nNow, coming back to the BCs of grad(mu)=0 and that the problem relaxes to the equilibrium state (so the driving force for evolution vanishes and, consequently, the magnitude of the residual also reduces). I tried initiaising a problem close to equilibrium and did indeed find difficulties in dropping the residual according to nl_rel_tol=1e-8 (managed to get to about 1.1e-8 but increasing the nl_rel_tol only pushes this problem further ahead in simulated time). As per the ReferenceResidualProblem documentation, the only solution I can see for this is to apply a suitably small nl_abs_tol. Is there a good way to identify a physically-reasonable value for this other than separating the physics out like I have done? In this 1D case, I have found that a nl_abs_tol=1e-18 (much smaller than before) works well.\nAs promised, if you want to play about with it to see what I mean, I have attached the input file. If there is a better way to get this to you, just let me know.\nThanks again!\nDiffusion_1D_simplified.zip",

You have single physics (obviously as you said) and no Dirichlet conditions...so actually your condition number is totally independent of your scaling factor. You can test your condition number by passing on the command line -pc_type svd -pc_svd_monitor. Note that you will not want to do this if your number of dofs is much greater than 1000...it takes too much CPU and memory. So yea regardless of scaling factor your condition number is about 4...which is really good. 1 is perfect. 1e16 is when you start running out of double precision.\nAnd even more unique are the conditions you outlined...you just have two terms, the time derivative and diffusion. As t -> infinity both of those terms will go to zero, so with ReferenceResidualProblem given enough time you will not be able to improve 8 orders of magnitude relative to zero. So you have arrived at one of the cases where nl_abs_tol is truly appropriate.\nI have attached an updated input file that uses ReferenceResidualProblem that works well without an absolute tolerance for about 18 time steps, and then it starts running out of precision.\nDiffusion_1D_simplified.txt",

If you set that to true then if the solution changes by less than the tolerance ss_check_tol (default is 1e-8), then your simulation is considered to be at a steady-state and your transient solve stops. This is very handy. However, you may still have to set a nl_abs_tol (or loosen the ss_check_tol) because you may run out of precision for nl_rel_tol as you're running up to that steady state. There is no tried and true way I think for determining nl_abs_tol...you kind of have to run your problem and see.\nUnfortunately, it is not currently possible to set an nl_abs_tol for individual variables.

It appears that the \"devel\" branch is reasonably current, but if you pulled from \"master\" or one of the other branches the source is going to be very out of date. Did you copy from \"devel\"?\nTo get a little closer to answering your question though, the problem is likely to do with registration of that sintering \"Action\". This is custom syntax that creates multiple objects with one block but since it's not registered in your application properly, MOOSE thinks you are just adding in some \"single\" kernel and made a syntax error (e.g. \"type\" is required in most basic input blocks and usually corresponds to the same named C++ source file). See if you get get her app working directly, then you can start moving things over. The other alternative would be to work with her directly and add to her application. She may be willing to collaborate with you directly in that application.",
