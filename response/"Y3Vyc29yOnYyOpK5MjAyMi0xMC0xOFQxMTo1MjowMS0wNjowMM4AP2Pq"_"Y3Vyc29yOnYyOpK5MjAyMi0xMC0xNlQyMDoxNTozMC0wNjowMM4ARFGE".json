Because at the solid-fluid interface, one side of the thin layer transfers heat with the solid, and the other side transfers heat with the fluid. The second is that when I add a thin layer to the fluid-solid interface (the thermal conductivity of the thin layer is much smaller than that of the solid), the heat transfer between the solid and the liquid is deteriorated. The maximum temperature of the solid should be higher after adding the thin layer. But the simulation results are the opposite. After adding the thin layer, the maximum temperature of the solid decreases. Here are some output files and a finer mesh.\n2layers_2d_midline.zip\nno_thin_layer.zip\nthin_layer_0.1.zip",

Do you need both?\n\nTo put it simply, I want to model fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer, where the solid is a heat source. During the flow process, the solid surface will be fouled, so a thin layer needs to be added to the fluid-solid interface to represent the thermal resistance caused by fouling.\n\nDo you really need two temperature variables, i.e., Ts and Tf? Would one T variable work?\n\nI think it is necessary to set the temperature variable separately in the fluid and solid areas. I used to set the temperature to T in both the solid and fluid regions, but it turned out that no matter what the htc was equal to, the answer I calculated would be the same.",

There's an enum there:\nhttps://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/namespacelibMesh.html#abcdbcd8364bf9fb7a67b3b4013031b2d\nThe nodal ones are lagrange and hierarchic iirc.\nWithin the code, you can perform a call to var->isNodal() (from a MooseVariable* pointer) to see if a variable is nodal\nGuillaume",
