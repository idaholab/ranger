          "bodyText": "Hello, moose community, i am a freshman in grain growth and moose modeling.\nI am trying to model slanted temperature-dependent grain growth behavior from experimental obervations and first following grain growth model in the work of \"Phase-field modeling of grain evolutions in additive manufacturing from nucleation, growth, to coarsening\" , the anisotropic grain growth behavior is similar as the following figures in the article:\n\nI simply modify some moose examples and modeling the temperature-dependent behavior, but did not quite understand how to model the anisotropic grain growth. Though i have test the examples in the dir ../GBAnisotropy/, I am still confused that how to model the slanted shape. Here is the result i can get using moose,  i just want to anisotropic modeling the shape as the black line.\n\nThe grain growth model in the article may be explicitly modeled by moose and do not need additional coding work.  It is saied that the anisotropic grain growth behavior by incorporating the anisotropic grain boundary energy:\n\nHowever, I did not find way to define the inclination angle in GBAnisotropy. Could anybody give some suggestions?",

Some equations in GBAnisotropyBase can not be found in the article and i am confused what it means.  For example, i did not find the definition in the following source code if the inclination is used and i am confused what phi_ave means and why it is equal to \"pi * n / (2.0 * _op_num)\".\n\n2\u3001I only found the following figure in the article can be related with the equation f_sigma=1+deltacos(4phi). It seems that the source code GBAnisotropy only define the weak inclination situation. If i want to simulate the elongate grain shape, I should change the equation f_sigma=(1+delta)^(-1)(1+delta*abs(cos(phi))) and let the delta to be 2?\n\n3\u3001I also tryied to simulate the test case \"moose/modules/phase_field/test/tests/GBAnisotropy/test3.i\". The grain shape is consistent with the figure in the article for delta_sigma=0.5 as following figure. But the simulation did not converge when delta_sigma is bigger e.g. delta_sigma=2.\n\n#Could anybody tell me more specific details and what should i do if i want simulate the elongate grain growth behaviour?",

The injection well seems to be going fine, but I'm having problems with the production well temperature increasing over time. I've seen some similar discussion and the solution was to use a Peaceman borehole description. I'm not sure how to do that and control the mass flow rate of the production well. It's quite easy to control that flowrate with a pointsource/sink term. But the problem is the temperature at the outflow node. I've tried a few different approaches using either polylinesink or pointsource in both falcon PTGeothermal and PorousFlow physics and seeing the same issue. So I'm pretty well convinced that I'm the problem. Can someone help me out here?\nPRODUCTION_VPO.txt",

This also then has $\\nabla \\varphi \\cdot \\hat{n} = 0$.\nIs there a reason you can think of why my $\\nabla \\varphi \\cdot \\hat{n} = 0$  boundary is not being obeyed properly? Below is an image of what I'm seeing.\n\nAll the best,\nGillian",
