          "bodyText": "Hello\nI create a simple diffusion problem like example02 where the diffusion coefficient and absorption coefficient are 0.008 and 0.085. At runtime, it is found that when the bottom boundary is very large for example, the bottom is 1e10 and no top BC, the calculation does not converge but it converges when it's less than a certain value like 1e6. Supposedly, the value at the bottom only magnifies or diminishes the calculated result, and will not affect the convergence. So  why it doesn't converge when the boundary conditions are large, and how to solve these problems. In addition, I want to ask what the terminal output 17 Linear |R| = 6.686767e+03 and 200 Nonlinear |R| = 4.442370e+08 represent.\nThanks very much",

(The result is essentially independent of refinement anyway)\nI assumed that the different reaction coefficients would simply be reflected in the entries of the mass matrix associated with the reaction kernel (so larger entries on the side with the larger coefficient, and something in between for the FE functions associated with nodes on the boundary between the two rectangles), but I would say this is not the case, and the solution seems to be carried out independently on the two subdomains.\nIs there a different way one should go about defining material zones? (I defined the two rectangles as physical groups in gmsh)\nWhen dealing with discontinuous properties across material boundaries, should one always make use of Interface Kernels?

Peacock is less fully-featured than paraview, I dont think you can draw lines through the geometry to check that.\nYou also seem to be plotting the flux, not the concentration. The flux being related to the first derivative, it s not necessarily continuous, and not with this variable type.\nAs long as the mesh is conformal at the interface, you do not need to use interface kernels. Physics (kernels) that extends across both domains will naturally be solved at the interface.\nGuillaume",

Now, in the next step, I trying to add failure criterion like Mohr-Coulomb to my model. I have got knoweldge how to apply Mohr-Coulomb from some examples such as:\nhttps://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/multi/paper3.i\nI just ran this example succesfully, but when I run the model the following errors pops up:\nThe following material properties are declared on block 2 by multiple materials\n\nBy the way, I used Thermal, Hydraulic and Mechanical material objects in the model, a part of it as follows:\n[Materials]\n  [./mc]\n    type = ComputeMultiPlasticityStress\n    ep_plastic_tolerance = 1e-3\n    plastic_models = 'tensile mc'\n    max_NR_iterations = 5\n    specialIC = 'rock'\n    debug_fspb = crash\n    block = '2 3 4 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21'\n  [../]\n  [./strain]\n    type = ComputeFiniteStrain\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n    block = '2 3 4 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21'\n  [../]\n  [./Elasticity_tensor]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = 15e9\n    poissons_ratio = 0.2\n    block = '2 3 4 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21'\n  [../]\n  [./thermal_expansion]\n    type = ComputeThermalExpansionEigenstrain\n    thermal_expansion_coeff = 1e-5\n    temperature = temperature\n    stress_free_temperature = temperature\n    eigenstrain_name = 'thermal_eigenstrain'\n    block = '2 3 4 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21'\n  [../]\n\nIt seems that there is kind of confliction between the objects declaring the material.\nDoes anyone know how can I handle this issue?\nThanks in advance\nRahim",

In which case, might be best to completely delete/uninstall mambaforge, reinstall it, and never again install stuff to the base environment :). Always create environments:\n(base) > mamba create -n paraview paraview\n(base) > mamba activate paraview\n(paraview) > paraview\n(I am posting this because I just learned that Paraview is available from Conda... neat! But that first launch took a while)",
