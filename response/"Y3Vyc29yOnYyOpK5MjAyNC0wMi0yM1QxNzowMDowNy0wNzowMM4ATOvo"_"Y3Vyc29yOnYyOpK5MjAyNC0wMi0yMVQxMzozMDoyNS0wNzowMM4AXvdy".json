This is how I install it on my own machines (after installing the MOOSE Conda packages):\nconda create -n paraview paraview\nconda activate paraview\nparaview\n<eventually pops up on the screen>\nIf the above does not work, yet Peacock is \"popping up\" on the screen, I really can't fathom why Paraview would not.",
