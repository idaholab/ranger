          "bodyText": "Dear all,\nquick question: I recently installed MOOSE (+ our applications) on the leonardo booster module at CINECA in Italy. All went fine and smooth, but when trying to run the tests  (failing) -  errors are related to having disabled the CUDA-aware support (this is by deqfault required from the openMPI module installed locally). This said, I was wondering if there is a simple way to disable the CUDA-aware support at the TestHarness script level, or in other words, where I can integrate the --mca  opal_warn_on_missing_libcuda 0 option. If not, I might go all the way to install locally openmpi. Please, keep in mind that this is not a top priority discussion, since production runs are fine (at least as long as I have tested), and it is only because I found it annoying not to be able to run the tests upon a new installation (users keep on asking me why tests are failing...).\nThanks for any advise,\nmauro",

The three dimensional problem has one variable, let's say u, and nodal problem has another variable, let's say v.

For one dimensional problem and one dimensional diffusion, I can draw the mesh as one straight line for one problem and a lot of orthogonal line at each node for diffusion problem.

This seemingly contradicts my earlier notion that each Quadrature Point corresponds to a single Node.\nI would greatly appreciate your help in clarifying these concepts and how they relate to finding the center point of an element's side.

They are associated with elements. This Wikipedia article describes our most commonly used quadrature rule. Quadrature points are used for numerical integration. They don't have any link to variable's degrees of freedom\n\nThe number of Vertices is determined by the type of the element, representing physically existing points.\n\nThis is true. I would probably not capitalize vertices because there is no vertex class type in libMesh/MOOSE whereas Point and Node are class types. Vertices are a subset of an element's Nodes. In the case of a Quad4 element, all the Nodes are vertices. However, with a Quad9 element there are also Nodes at the mid-points of element edges and also a Node at the center of the element. 4 vertex nodes + 4 mid-edge nodes + center node = 9 nodes in total.",
