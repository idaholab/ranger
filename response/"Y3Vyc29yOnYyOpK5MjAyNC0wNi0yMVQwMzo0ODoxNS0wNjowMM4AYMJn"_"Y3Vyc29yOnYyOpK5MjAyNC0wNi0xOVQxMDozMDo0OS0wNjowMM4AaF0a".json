I do not know anything obout Moose, so the \"translation\" is difficult for me.\nThe FMI Interface does not know anything about meshes etc. The variable are typically used as \"signals\", not as spacially distributed fields in the multy-physics sense.\nBut your could give new meaning to certain array variables in a layered standard on top of FMI (see https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0.1/#VersioningLayered and https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php/Bertsch-Beyond_FMI_-_Towards_New_Applications_with_Layered_Standards-132_a.pdf?page=downloadPaper&filename=Bertsch-Beyond_FMI_-_Towards_New_Applications_with_Layered_Standards-132_a.pdf&form_id=132&form_version=final  for the concept of layered standards) for your use cases - this is what is done for in fmi-ls-bus and fmi-ls-struct.\nBefore you go the a spatially distributed multi-phyiscs-extension of FMI, I think exchanging avarage values e.g.  on surfaces with a system simulation tool via signals is the lower hanging fruit.
