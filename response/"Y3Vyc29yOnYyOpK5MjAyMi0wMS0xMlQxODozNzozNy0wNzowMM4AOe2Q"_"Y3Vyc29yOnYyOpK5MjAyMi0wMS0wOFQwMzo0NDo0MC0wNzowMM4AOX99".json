          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI want to first thank the MOOSE team for making the installation so easy to perform through mamba. However, I am facing the issue of not being able to run the jobs with the Slurm workload manager. I receive an error that is as follows: \"Error: node list format not recognized. Try using '-hosts=' \". The culprit is the 3.3.2 version of MPICH used in the environment packaged in moose-tools. To better understand the issue at hand, I ask the reader to follow this link  https://lists.mpich.org/pipermail/discuss/2019-December/005835.html . I request the MOOSE community to provide answers to the following questions:\n\nIs there a way to circumvent the issue with the existing MPICH 3.3.2 version?\nIs it possible to upgrade MPICH in the package to a later version?\n\nThanks,\nSreekar",

But as GuidGuid stated, we try and refrain from asking users to install our Conda packages on High Performance Computing clusters. The compilers which come with the Conda (Mamba) install are not optimized. Meaning they are designed to run on just about any modern CPU architecture. e.g:\n# equal to or greater than micro-architecture\n-mtune=haswell\n# Intel/AMD CPUs dating back to 2013",

But there is a small issue.\nI am simulating particle embedded in a matrix with only particle treated as an active domain for diffusion.\nI am providing flux on the surface of the particle.\n\nDiffusion works fine within the particle i.e., it increases with time. But -ve value comes right above the particle surface whose value increases with time. I have a figure here for your reference.\nI have tried with different mesh sizes but it keeps on popping out for every case with value increasing with time.\nCan you please help me to remove that scenario? I shall be very thankful.\nBest\nAvtar",
