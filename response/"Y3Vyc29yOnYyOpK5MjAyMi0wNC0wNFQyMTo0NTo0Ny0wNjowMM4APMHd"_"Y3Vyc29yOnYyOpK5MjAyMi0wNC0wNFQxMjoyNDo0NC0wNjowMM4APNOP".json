          "bodyText": "I have looked for, but have been unable to find, a quantitative definition for how the mesh bias variable behaves.  Is this essentially a geometric series, where the distance between node 0 and n for n > 0 is given by:\ndistance = sum (a r^(n - 1) ) = a(1 - r^(n-1)) / 1 - r\nwhere a is the first spacing (i.e. between nodes 0 and 1), r is the bias value and n is the node number?\nI suspect there is a very simple explanation for this but I run into problems as there are three parameters to define in the mesh block: the number of nodes, the distance spanned and the bias value.  Does this mean that by choosing the length of a particular dimension and the number of nodes I wish to use, the bias value is fixed?  But if the geometric nature is true then one should also be able to define the first spacing, a.   The more I look at it the further away I get from understanding it!  If there is a definition on the MOOSE help pages then I would appreciate a link to it.  Many thanks in advance for the help.",

This is especially important in framework objects, because \"modules\" classes tend to be documented from a user's perspective, so are generally easy to understand (but not always).  Please take care to use well-written and explanatory english, not things like params.addParam<Real>(\"coef\", 1, \"The coefficient\");.  Please take care to provide well-written markdown documentation, not just barely-filled stubs like\n!syntax description blah\n!syntax parameters blah\n!syntax inputs blah\n!syntax children blah\n\nPlease include examples so users don't have to trawl the test files.",
