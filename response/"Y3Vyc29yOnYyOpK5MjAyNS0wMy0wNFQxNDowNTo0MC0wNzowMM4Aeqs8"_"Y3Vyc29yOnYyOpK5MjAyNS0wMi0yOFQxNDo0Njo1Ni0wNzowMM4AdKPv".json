          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI'm currently creating a multiphysics simulation between Griffin-HT-THM. For the THM I'm creating a coarse model that models the core as a single channel approximation. Due to the geometry of the core, the fuel and thus q_wall discretization requires a non-uniform axial discretization. In HT, the q_wall is computed as a UserObject using LayeredSideAverage for three regions which are the lower, middle and upper. I then transfer these into THM under the names q_wall_lay1, q_wall_lay2 and q_wall_acmdz, where the THM model is setup in the following way:\n[Materials]\n  [f_mat]\n    type = ADWallFrictionFunctionMaterial\n    f_D = f_D\n    function = 0.0194\n  []\n\n  [Re_mat]\n    type = ADReynoldsNumberMaterial\n    block = 'channel:lay1 channel:acmdz channel:lay2'\n    Re = Re\n    D_h = 0.0029\n    mu = 0.0001582\n    vel = 0.6119\n    rho = 669.92\n  []\n\n  [Pr_mat]\n    type = ADPrandtlNumberMaterial\n    block = 'channel:lay1 channel:acmdz channel:lay2'\n    cp = cp\n    mu = mu\n    k = k\n  []\n  [Nu_mat]\n    type = ADParsedMaterial\n    block = 'channel:lay1 channel:acmdz channel:lay2'\n    # Dittus-Boelter\n    expression = '0.021 * pow(Re, 0.8) * pow(Pr, 0.4)'\n    property_name = 'Nu'\n    material_property_names = 'Re Pr'\n  []\n  [Hw_mat]\n    type = ADConvectiveHeatTransferCoefficientMaterial\n    block = 'channel:lay1 channel:acmdz channel:lay2'\n    D_h = D_h\n    Nu = Nu\n    k = k\n  []\n  [T_wall_lay1]\n    type = ADTemperatureWall3EqnMaterial\n    Hw = Hw\n    T = T\n    q_wall = q_wall_lay1\n    block = 'channel:lay1'\n  []\n  [T_wall_acmdz]\n    type = ADTemperatureWall3EqnMaterial\n    Hw = Hw\n    T = T\n    q_wall = q_wall_acmdz\n    block = 'channel:acmdz'\n  []\n  [T_wall_lay2]\n    type = ADTemperatureWall3EqnMaterial\n    Hw = Hw\n    T = T\n    q_wall = q_wall_lay2\n    block = 'channel:lay2'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Components]\n  [channel]\n    type = FlowChannel1Phase\n    position = '0 0 0'\n    orientation = '0 0 1'\n\n    A = ${A_flow}\n    D_h = ${hydraulics_diameter}\n    length = '${lay1} ${acm_dz} ${lay2}'\n    n_elems = '1       8         1'\n    PoD = '${pd_ratio}'\n    axial_region_names = 'lay1 acmdz lay2'\n  []\n\n  [inlet]\n    type = InletMassFlowRateTemperature1Phase\n    input = 'channel:in'\n    m_dot = ${mdot}\n    T = ${inlet_T}\n  []\n\n  [outlet]\n    type = Outlet1Phase\n    input = 'channel:out'\n    p = ${outlet_P}\n  []\n\n  [ht_ext]\n    type = HeatTransferFromExternalAppHeatFlux1Phase\n    flow_channel = channel\n    P_hf = '${P_wet_core}'\n  []\n[]\n\nMy question is how would I apply the heat fluxes on those blocks explicitly?

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI'm wondering what the 'best' way to access both variables, and aux variables at some arbitrary node is - for example, at the nearest node on a particular boundary, or a neighbour to the current node. Obtaining the node ID's is not a problem.\nI have had some success by setting the coupled variable type to be an integer in the header file, then using this to to get the dof number for that variable at a particular node, and finally pulling the appropriate value out from _nl.sys.currentSolution.\nThis was an approach I saw in another auxkernel (I'd have to dig around to remember which one!), rather than something I came up with myself.\nThe problem I am now having is that it doesn't seem to work for aux variables?\nWhen I try and pass in aux variables using the same syntax, the integer associated with them is negative. Even stranger to me, the value doesn't change whether I include the aux variable in the input file or not (it is not a required variable).\nAll of this makes me think the negative integer values I'm seeing associated with aux variables here are nonsense?\nNow I'm wondering two things:\n\n\nAre aux variables also stored in currentSolution, or are they dealt with differently? Is there a way I can access their values at a specific node?\n\n\nIs there a conventional way of doing this in general? So far I have been using a method from another aux kernel, but perhaps this isn't the intended/best method for achieving this?\n\n\nHopefully the problem makes sense - if anything needs clarification, please let me know.\nThanks!",

If you do happen to know of any threads I should take a look at, these are very welcome (and apologies if this turns out to be a duplicate!).\nThanks for pointing out the different systems - I'll look at the auxiliary system documentation to try and get the right syntax.\nNegative integers (in my head, I'm expecting these to represent an index?) associated with the aux variables still seems strange, but I could be misunderstanding what's going on behind the scenes, and what these values represent?\nEven stranger is the fact they don't change, whether I do or don't pass in a variable from the input file, so I think I must be totally going wrong in this part.\nJust in case I've done something daft in the code, I have const int _myAuxVar in the header file, then params.addCoupledVar(\"myAuxVar\") and _myAuxVar(coupled(\"myAuxVar\")) in the class definition and initialiser list in the .C file.",

I understand this approach provides greater flexibility. However, for tightly coupled systems of PDEs, such as the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, this requires repeatedly declaring couplings for nearly every kernel, material property, etc., which seems suboptimal.\nI noticed that MOOSE supports LAGRANGE_VEC variables, where the components are inherently coupled. This got me wondering: is it possible for a user to define a vector variable with DIM+2 components (e.g., velocity vector + density + temperature) so that these variables are coupled by default? This would allow implementing the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in their compact form, simplifying variable transformations.\nI looked through the forums and example codes but couldn\u2019t find anyone doing this. Is this approach feasible in MOOSE? If so, what would be the pros and cons? How would it effect computational efficiency? Some drawbacks I can think of is reduced efficiency in automatic differentiation, less code flexibility, but there may be others I haven\u2019t considered.\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences!\nAdditional information\nNo response",

It's closer to what I want, but I still have a few follow-up questions:\n\nDoes ArrayKernels still support the use of ArrayKernelsValues and ArrayKernelsGrad to automatically apply the test and gradient of the test function?\nIf the answer is yes, what data type does precomputeQpJacobian return for ArrayKernelsGrad? In this context, precomputeQpResidual already returns a RealEigenMatrix, so precomputeQpJacobian should return a 3D matrix, but I am not sure how to assign the data type.\nI see when using ArrayKernels, we will need to write separate function for diagonal entry and off-diagonal entry. However, I found it's easier to compute the entire Jacobian matrix together when working with compact form. I am wondering if there is a way to achieve this?",

MOOSE supports tensors at various orders which should have the generality we need. Here it's a little more complex because array variables use RealEigenVectors iirc as the backend data container.\nThe \"precomputeQp\" is a small optimization. You can work with computeQpJacobian instead as most kernels do\n\n\nYou can override the base classes if you want to modify how the assembly is done. I would recommend you follow how it's done in MOOSE now, then when it works you can optimize. There should be quite a few examples of array kernels, though for most each component will have roughly the same equation",

I completely agree with you that it\u2019s ideal to avoid modifying the MOOSE implementation directly.\nI wanted to ask for your opinion on the following approach: I could develop a material system to compute and store the residual and Jacobian in vector/matrix form, and then couple it with the kernel system to access the appropriate entries and apply the test functions. This approach would allow me to work with vector and matrix forms while avoiding modifications to the DiagJacobian and OffDiagJacobian implementations. It would also maintain the separation of variables for flexibility.\nHowever, I have a few questions and concerns regarding the implementation of this approach:\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the material system is only called once per Newton iteration? Otherwise, this approach might result in significant repeating computation.\nIs there a way to automatically include all variables in the material system when developing a kernel system?\nI noticed that MOOSE provides built-in output_properties for material systems, but the default output uses MONOMIAL. Is there a way to change the output to LAGRANGE?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and guidance. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",

We used this version of MOOSE.\nI'm using --oversubscribe because originally I was seeing these issues when I was running across multiple cluster nodes. I then made this small test case which hangs with 32 procs. If you're running it on a single machine you might not have 32 cores to run this on so you'll need to oversubscribe.",

I can damage connections and change the number of intact nodes, but not actually extend a crack.\n\nPeridynamics represents fracture by breaking bonds, so there really isn't a description of the exact location of a crack. If you're able to damage connections, it's probably basically working for you.\n\nQUESTION 2: Are there any demonstrations of growing cracks using the XFEMRankTwoTensorMarkerUserObject in 3D. I have not been able to initiate secondary cracks or extend a RectangleCutUserObject. The Marker object seems to be insensitive to the threshold parameter.\n\nThat XFEMRankTwoTensorMarkerUserObject does ad-hoc extension of the cracks element by element. That works in 2D, but it isn't readily extensible in 3D. It's not really the best way to do things in 2D either because the stresses at the crack tips are singular, so the results are sensitive to mesh refinement. I would recommend focusing on the mesh-based cutter, which represents the cutting plane by a lower-dimensional mesh and uses fracture integrals. That's reasonably robust in 2D, and much more experimental in 3D.\n\nQUESTION 3: There are 3 demonstrations of growing cracks in the modules/xfem/test/tests/solid_mechanics_basic/ folder, but it is almost impossible to extend the scripts to work on geometriess bigger than 5x5x2. I have also been unable to define more than one crack either within the .xda file or by usinging multiple CrackMeshCut3DUserObject. In the first case, the error was \"A fragment boundary edge can't have more than 1 cuts.\" In the second case, the code crashed my computer by using up all memory.\n\nI guess I'd need to learn more about what wasn't working in going to larger geometries. There are a lot of corner cases, so we do occasionally hit those types of errors that you're seeing. I'm not sure what was going on with it using up memory. There are currently some scalability issues with XFEM regarding memory usage, but we have successfully used it on models up to maybe 1 million nodes.\nQUESTION 4: I was able to generalize the edge_crack_3d_propagation script to 10x10x10 and 20 time steps by reducing the size_control parameter and allowing growth in the x, y, and z directions, but with faster growth or longer runs, I would get error \"attempting to add edge intersection when one already exists with different node.\"\nYou've probably hit another corner case here.\nQUESTION 5: When I try to extend the in mhs or fatique versions of this script, I get error \"the crack front and the tracked crack front definition must match in terms of their end nodes.\" Or error \"Invalid distance r in CrackFrontDefinition::calculateRThetaToCrackFront.\"\n...and yet another corner case! 3D XFEM is gnarly.\nI believe it's possible to work through most of these issues, but it sounds like maybe you're gravitating toward smeared cracking. I would be happy to talk through this with you.",

(2) Use SideDiffusiveFluxIntegral to extract these heat values \u222b-D\u2202T/\u2202n dA for Layer 1, Layer 2,..., Layer 10.\nSo I make an example of heat conduction problem in a cylinder with a cosine distribution heat source.

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI would like to simulate a hydro-mechanical groundwater model investigating on land subsidence due to groundwater abstraction. In a first step, I want to build a steady state model without abstracting any water. My model contains 5 layers (3 aquifers and 2 aquitards, find more information below). Since the upper aquifer is not confined, I use the PorousFlowUnsaturated model. I would like to get groundwater flow from my inflow boundary condition (DirichletBC on left side) to my outflow boundary condition (DirichletBC on right side). However, no matter how I adjust the boundary conditions, either I don\u2019t get a flow between inflow and outflow or the model does not converge. I already tried to set the boundary conditions as Dirichlet BCs and as PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink boundary conditions as quasi Dirichlet BCs, but nothing worked out.\nMy model contains 5 layers. From top to bottom:\n\nOGWL: partially unsaturated;  on the left side is set a higher hydraulic head then on the right side\nOZH: aquitard; no flow is defined\nMGWL: confined aquifer; a hydraulic head is set only on the left side; a no flow is defined on the right side\nUZH: aquitard; no flow is defined\nUGWL: confined aquifer; a hydraulic head is set only on the left side; a no flow is defined on the right side\n\nThe boundary conditions are defined as depth-dependent (z-direction) functions of porepressures using an if-condition to set the hydraulic head at the left and right BC. The solver is a transient solver modelling steadystate conditions.\nEspecially for the OGWL I expect a gradient and different porepressure values at the boundaries left and right. Above the hydraulic heads set for OGWL I expect the porepressure values to be zero, but instead they are negative. My model does not converge. I get really high positive linear and non linear residuals. When I model the OGWL to be completely dry, the model converges easily. So somehow the modelling of the partially unsaturated layer seems not to work.\nIn order to avoid complex effects and accelerate test runs, I built up a smaller hydraulic test model with the same setup and set boundary conditions. This model is converging. Unfortunately:\n\nThe porepressure values on the left and right boundary are the exact same value. I receive an unrealistic porepressure distribution.\nThe flow velocity in x-direction shows a groundwater flow from the center of the model to the left and right boundaries, instead of a flow from the left to the right boundary\nThe porepressure values above water table are still negative. To solve this problem I added at the top of the model a porepressure = 0 boundary condition, but then a vertical gradient with positive porepressure values is calculated. That's also unexpected cause there should be no water at all, so the porepressure values should be zero.\n\nI attached my mesh and input file for my test model. small-model.zip\nAny ideas how to get a correct porepressure gradient are very welcomed and highly appreciated.\nThanks in advance!",

Use high conductivity for all layers to avoid convergence issues caused by low permeability. After reaching SS, adjust the value to the real one. Also, try setting your pp at the bottom of the model. If you want flow from left to right, set pp at the bottom nodes of your boundary.\nIf you need a thunder pressure distribution over depth, set pp at the bottom nodes of each layer. If your mesh is too complex to extract those nodes, you can use a more advanced mesher like LaGriT, which allows for these types of adjustments.",

Cause I can only set at this curves a porepressure, when MOOSE recognizes them. And for this, the physical curves in Gmsh needs to be saved as mesh entities. I also wanted to try it with LaGriT but I don't understand how to download it.\nIf not, it is no problem. I just thought maybe you have worked with Gmsh earlier.",
