          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI'm currently setting up VSCode to work with MOOSE. I followed the instructions on the website and the things listed are working fine as far as I can tell.\nHowever afterwards I received some include errors and was missing auto-completion so I searched the forum and found #25775. I used that as a reference and copied the c_cpp_properties.json. Then VSCode told me wasphit/HITInterpreter.h was missing as a dependency of several of my header files. I therefore added wasp to includePath. Currently my c_cpp_properties.json looks like this:\n{\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Linux\",\n            \"includePath\": [\n                \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/build/header_symlinks\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/build/header_symlinks\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/modules/module_loader/build/header_symlinks\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/boost/include\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/hit\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/wasp\",\n                \"${HOME}/mambaforge3/envs/moose/include\",\n                \"${HOME}/mambaforge3/envs/moose/libmesh/include\",\n                \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/json/include\"\n            ],\n            \"defines\": [],\n            \"compilerPath\": \"${HOME}/mambaforge3/envs/moose/bin/mpicxx\",\n            \"cStandard\": \"c11\",\n            \"cppStandard\": \"c++17\",\n            \"intelliSenseMode\": \"clang-x64\",\n            \"compileCommands\": \"${workspaceFolder}/compile_commands.json\",\n            \"browse\": {\n                \"path\": [\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}/build/header_symlinks\",\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/build/header_symlinks\",\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/modules/module_loader/build/header_symlinks\",\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/boost/include\",\n                    \"${workspaceFolder}/../moose/framework/contrib/hit\",\n                    \"${HOME}/mambaforge3/envs/moose/include\",\n                    \"${HOME}/mambaforge3/envs/moose/libmesh/include\"\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"version\": 4\n}\n\nThe only warning left right now is a missing compile_commands.json referenced in the code above. However I haven't found a guide on this topic.\nSo my two questions are:\n\nWhere do I get compile_commands.json from?\nIs my VSCode setup complete once I aquire said file?",

Since the only flux/boundary term I actually want to use is the one from the t equation (i.e q.n = 0 on all natural boundaries)? I did try that but it still didn't converge. Or what boundary conditions would be closest to the usual formulation in ADHeatConduction?\nAlso, to be honest I don't know what most of those options in the Executioner mean, I should probably look into them further. I copied them from another input file when I was initially learning to use MOOSE with the basic understanding that if I used solve_type = 'PJFNK' and made my custom physics inherit from ADKernel, I wouldn't need to code my Jacobians myself thanks to automatic differentiation. I haven't looked in detail at what the rest of the options mean apart from the tolerance.\ncreated the repository btw: https://github.com/richmondodufisan/purple",

Generally when debugging I always use -pc_type lu since that is basically a direct inversion of the preconditioning matrix, so it is the strongest preconditioner you can apply and will work with all systems. It just has very poor efficiency for large matrices.\n\nOne thing that I did notice though, is the \"outlier variable residual norms\" in red. What does that mean?\n\nIt just means that it's residual is larger than the other variable by a significant margin. But you've dropped the overall residual norm by 10 orders of magnitude so I would not worry about it.",

I have simplified the geometry significantly and created an MWE which reproduces the issue. The figure below shows the pressure drop increasing exponentially from about t=0.05 s to eventually crash at t~1.61 s.\n\nFollowing the guidelines in \"Troubleshooting failed solves\" page, I have changed the initial condition from velocity=0 to one based on inlet velocity and flow divisions, I also fixed the diameter as constant. I also scaled the variables to improve the solution. The convergence seems fine throughout the whole simulation (see log below):\nTime Step 16100, time = 1.61, dt = 0.0001\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n         junction-728:rhoEV: 0.954486\n         junction-728:rhoV:  0.00838734\n         junction-728:rhouV: 42.7522\n         junction-728:rhovV: 19.5515\n         junction-728:rhowV: 4.37464\n         junction-733:rhoEV: 5.49613\n         junction-733:rhoV:  0.00634548\n         junction-733:rhouV: 24.375\n         junction-733:rhovV: 110.444\n         junction-733:rhowV: 288.872\n         rhoA:               0.0411604\n         rhoEA:              0.0550817\n         rhouA:              0.060198\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 3.138465e+02\n      0 Linear |R| = 3.138465e+02\n      1 Linear |R| = 2.163226e+02\n      2 Linear |R| = 1.535664e+00\n      3 Linear |R| = 2.392176e-01\n      4 Linear |R| = 5.622355e-03\n      5 Linear |R| = 1.110909e-05\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n         junction-728:rhoEV: 0.0501407\n         junction-728:rhoV:  3.20005e-05\n         junction-728:rhouV: 1.77731\n         junction-728:rhovV: 1.16674\n         junction-728:rhowV: 0.00863554\n         junction-733:rhoEV: 0.54433\n         junction-733:rhoV:  0.00175378\n         junction-733:rhouV: 1.42963\n         junction-733:rhovV: 9.53675\n         junction-733:rhowV: 0.163855\n         rhoA:               0.000152264\n         rhoEA:              0.000190096\n         rhouA:              0.000191392\n 1 Nonlinear |R| = 9.891371e+00\n      0 Linear |R| = 9.891371e+00\n      1 Linear |R| = 6.471072e-02\n      2 Linear |R| = 8.884682e-03\n      3 Linear |R| = 3.197219e-04\n      4 Linear |R| = 2.780930e-07\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n         junction-728:rhoEV: 3.04345e-06\n         junction-728:rhoV:  7.24824e-09\n         junction-728:rhouV: 2.56967e-06\n         junction-728:rhovV: 4.03091e-06\n         junction-728:rhowV: 9.483e-09\n         junction-733:rhoEV: 0.000150371\n         junction-733:rhoV:  7.11678e-07\n         junction-733:rhouV: 0.000148026\n         junction-733:rhovV: 0.000999644\n         junction-733:rhowV: 1.02263e-05\n         rhoA:               6.19741e-08\n         rhoEA:              1.52932e-07\n         rhouA:              8.7553e-08\n 2 Nonlinear |R| = 1.021738e-03\n      0 Linear |R| = 1.021738e-03\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.061215e-05\n      2 Linear |R| = 4.211359e-07\n      3 Linear |R| = 1.911311e-08\n      4 Linear |R| = 3.632826e-12\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n         junction-728:rhoEV: 2.11386e-13\n         junction-728:rhoV:  1.88877e-14\n         junction-728:rhouV: 4.01883e-11\n         junction-728:rhovV: 4.57945e-12\n         junction-728:rhowV: 1.66978e-13\n         junction-733:rhoEV: 1.39089e-12\n         junction-733:rhoV:  2.88641e-14\n         junction-733:rhouV: 1.24345e-13\n         junction-733:rhovV: 1.33582e-12\n         junction-733:rhowV: 7.95808e-13\n         rhoA:               1.56777e-12\n         rhoEA:              2.15145e-12\n         rhouA:              2.16606e-12\n 3 Nonlinear |R| = 4.064838e-11\n Solve Converged!\n\nOutlier Variable Residual Norms:\n  junction-728:rhouV: 4.018830e-11\n\nBut not long after, the time-step becomes very small and the simulation crashes. I thought maybe this was due to the fluid properties which I fixed as constant becoming less accurate as pressure and temperature change non-homogeneously, but when I changed to Water97FluidProperties the simulation diverges really quick (within a few steps due to issue with line search), so I guess that is a different problem and I should focus on this one first.\nI have attached the input file. Hopefully someone could manage to provide some assistance. Happy to provide more information, log files or anything else that could be useful.\nBest wishes,\nJosh\ncoolant-simulation-for-github.i.txt",

When I was setting up the MWE, I found that if I remove the junctions \"junction-232\" and \"junction-14\" (pretty much the bends in the pipe attached to inlet and outlet, which would create a straight path from the inlet to the volumejunction, and volumejunction to outlet) then the simulation was stable. I could not figure out why, so I guess this is maybe related.",

Adding a Coulomb gauge, in particular, is something that is on my roadmap for the coming months of development for a research project, but isn't ready yet.\nThe gauge invariance isn't handled by the test function. We use a first-order Nedelec vector basis from libMesh for most problems, and the recent introduction of Raviart-Thomas elements in libMesh is something I also want to explore. So, if you wanted to attempt to define a gauge in your problem, the test function should not affect the results or convergence (at least in a way specific to the gauge, I believe). @lindsayad or @roystgnr may be able to give some insight on the libMesh test functions and correct me if I am wrong here.",

It might be wise to stop reading this comment after that sentence.\nIs the idea here that we're solving for a divergence-free vector field like the magnetic field B, and \u2207\u00b7B=0 implies that there exists a potential-vector field A such that B=\u2207\u00d7A, so we'd like to be able to just solve for A directly and get a strongly divergence-free B, but the problem is that A is only unique up to some transformation (like adding \u2207\u03a9 for some smooth \u03a9) that changes A but not B?\nIf you're solving a problem like that in 2D, you can use a variable defined with one of the libMesh C\u00b9 scalar-valued elements (CLOUGH works on general grids; HERMITE is more efficient if you have a cartesian mesh), treat its values as if they were magnitudes of a vector field in the z direction, take the curl of that field to get a divergence-free vector field in the xy plane, and the kernel of that operation is just the constant fields so you can add a single extra residual term to pin the value at one point to get a well-defined potential.\nIf you're solving a problem like that in 3D, you could still use three HERMITE variables to give you components of a C\u00b9 vector field, and take the curl of that to get a divergence-free 3D vector field ... but now the kernel isn't a simple one-dimensional thing, it's dimensionality is something like a third of your degrees of freedom.  Maybe there's some efficient way to constrain that and keep going, but when I looked at that problem during my PhD I was advised to find something easier instead.",
