Although I could see the grain g rowth rate to be reducing with time, They never reach a steady state. instead, dt keeps reducing until the point when the simulation terminates with an error that dt_min is reached. is there a way I can define in my code the minimum threadhold beyond which the residual becomes zero?\nRegards,\nAshish",

I have tried different approaches, including directly computing the residual for the term with the mixed partial derivative using _var.secondSln(), as well as integrating by parts to reduce the mixed partial derivative term to two first-order partial derivative terms.\n\nDespite these attempts, convergence remains unattainable.\nIn my tests, if I simplify the problem to Mat(x,y)\u2202F(x,y)/\u2202y=Q, I can achieve correct convergence by directly computing the residual term for the left-hand side of the equation using _grad_u in the Kernel. However, this approach also has issues since it still requires JFNK instead of PJFNK. When attempting to solve using PJFNK, I receive the following errors:\n  Linear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_PC_FAILED iterations 0\n                 PC failed due to FACTOR_NUMERIC_ZEROPIVOT \nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_LINE_SEARCH iterations 0\n\nDoes anyone know how to address this issue?",

In 2021, a similar question was asked (##19475), and the recommendation was to use integral transforms for differential reduction. I've tried this method, but MOOSE fails to converge during the computation.\nI'm curious if there have been any updates or advancements in how MOOSE handles second-order mixed partial derivatives. I noticed that the code related to the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations in MOOSE seems to include variables for second-order derivatives (e.g., _second_u_vel(coupledSecond(\"u\"))), although I recall that the INS module does not include mixed second-order partial derivatives.\nThe specific mixed second-order partial derivative I need to handle is:\n\nAny guidance or insights on how to properly implement this in MOOSE would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I successfully had MOOSE on Sawtooth. Then I tried to add some custom kernels and make the program, but I accidentally did it when I was in Lemhi, and it broke everything.\nI then tried to \"fix\" the install by updating it, but I was not in a login node, so I think that did more damage. I thought the best course of action would then be to just \"delete\" the files and start over, but that, of course, did not fix anything. What should I do to get MOOSE on either Lemhi, sawtooth or both? I attached an image with the error below.\nThank you for your time, and I apologize for the headache!\nAlso, I'm just curious why the user needs to have separate instances of moose on Lemhi and Sawtooth. Also, I've seen 2 sawtooth hpcs(1 & 2). Do I need a separate instance of MOOSE on sawtooth 1 and 2 as well?",

The two machines are different, with different compiler libraries. When you build on Lemhi (make), and then accidentally continue to develop and build on Sawtooth (additional makes) is when you'll run into compiling issues.\nThis is why we ask users to create some sort of directory separation (~/projects/sawtooth).\nAs for starting completely over and still hitting a snag... I think we do have issues with all our moose-dev modules on every cluster at the moment... Can you try to build on bitterroot within a container instead (we don't have instructions for this yet, so I'll walk you through it)?\nGain a shell on Bitterroot:\n\nThen perform the following:\nmodule load use.moose moose-containers moose\nmoose-shell\nYou'll be placed into a container with all the fixings. Proceed to build your application as normal (you may need to clean your repo before obtaining a successful build).\nNoteThe container will have PETSc, libMesh, and WASP already built! So proceed directly to running make in your application.\n\nTipWe will eventually include these instructions as the only way to develop with MOOSE. That being said, when we do, there will be no need to create directory separations (~/projects/sawtooth; ~/projects/lemhi). Containers are immutable, relocatable objects. They are designed to work everywhere and provide the same experience when doing so.\n\ntagging @loganharbour if he has anything to add",

But I suspect very few folks need this capability.\nAs I stated previously, there is still something wrong with every moose-dev module on every one of our cluster machines (Lemhi, Sawtooth, and Bitterroot). And I am not sure we are going to even attempt to fix it! We've been wanting to move away from native builds on our clusters for some time. Moving forwards, its best to stick with using containers on our HPC machines:\nmodule load use.moose moose-containers moose\nmoose-shell\n<do application development>\nAs for your question about launching jobs via PBS/Slurm, I'm afraid we only have this working for vetted applications at the moment. I am actively looking into a solution for you, and will report back when I have one. This shouldn't be long...

In this example, I aimed to initiate two grains, gr0 and gr1, and then create a nucleus with the same grain ID (gr1) after some time steps. I used \"DiscreteNucleationForce\" as the kernel for this purpose. However, I encountered an issue: after the holding time, the nucleus suddenly disappears (not smoothly), and the other crystal with the same grain ID (gr1) also vanishes.\nCan anyone explain why this happens? Is it possible to insert a nucleus with an existing grain ID?\nI have attached my ihnput file with is \ud83d\udc4d\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Mesh]\n    # Mesh block.

We might have to dig around some to see if it's not supported with an older C library.\nFrom lpeterse/haskell-socket#8 it looks like it might just not be available.\n@aclin4 can you try adding #define MSG_NOSIGNAL 0  in the top of that http.C include and see if it compiles?\nI can come up with a better solution once I'm online, but this should be a sanity check. We shouldn't be hitting that line of code so even though this is a hacky fix, it should at least get things working for you in the interim.",

Before I was able to try your suggestion, I managed to fix the issue by updating my version of Command Line Tools for Xcode, as it wasn't automatically updated with my MacOS update.\nIf you want to try and recreate the issue, I think I was getting the error on Command Line Tools for Xcode 11.5 and fixed the issue by updating to version 15.0.\nIn case anyone runs into a similar issue, try updating Command Line Tools for Xcode via the Apple Developer app store.",
