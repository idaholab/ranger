          "bodyText": "Dear all,\nI am using FeatureFloodCount to determine the number of two new phases generated in the microstructure. The single phase-field variable has a value of -1 and 1 inside two different phases. Interestingly, FeatureFloodCount is only counting phases having a field value of 1. It is not counting the phases having a value of -1 and therefore, not included in the CSV file. Means, FeatureFloodCount is only considering the phase value range from 0 to 1, while 0 to -1 is neglected. Do I need to adjust something in the FeatureFloodCount so that the entire range 1 to -1 is included in the counting process? Do you have advice for me? Thanks.",

The paper implements a finite difference model, however I want to solve the same equations using finite element and thought MOOSE might be a good framework to try it in.\nI have converted the final system of equations derived in the paper to their weak forms, and I have split up the terms in order to represent them as individual kernels.\nHere are the equations:\n\nNow because of how the equations are formulated I have found some issues in making them compatible with MOOSE and would like some advice.\nFirstly, the four equations solve for the coupled variables P_f, phi, P_T, and v_s respectively. However, since many of the kernels in each equation are functions of different parameters or coupled variables it seems I cannot use premade kernels in the MOOSE framework, so I have been trying to implement custom ADKernels for each of the terms and just have them contribute to the residual for their respective variable to be solved.\nFurthermore, I wanted to treat rho_T and [rho_s X_s (1 - phi)] as material properties since I would compute rho_f, rho_s, and X_s using some interpolation I have precalculated. But in equation 1 and 2, I require their time derivative and it seems like it isn't possible to recover time derivatives of material properties. I have tried computing rho_T and [rho_s X_s (1-phi)] as AuxVariables so I can retrieve the time derivative, but it seems AuxVariables are not compatible with AutoDiff.\nIs there a good method for addressing this kind of problem?\nAlso, for equation 4, I am wondering if it is advised to solve for velocity using the components as scalars or a single VectorVariable? So far I have tried creating a kernel that solves each component of the residual, but it seems like just treating velocity as a vector would be simpler to implement. Also, I considered using the solid mechanics module, but the solid here is described moreso as a viscous fluid with compressibility defined in eq. 3, so I figured it would just be simplest to create a custom kernel. But the Lagrangian derivatives in eq. 3 suggest to me that it might be simpler to implement using the solid mechanics module.\nI appreciate any advice that can help me out.\nThank you,\nAustin",

(BodyForce?) kernel to add it to the equation. But coding your own kernel is a good way to do this\nFor the second item, the way to have material property time derivatives is to use a chain rule. You create your own material which defined the time derivative of the material property (declaring it the same way as a material property) by computing it as:\ndmat/dt = sum dmat/dxi dxi/dt\nWith the xi being the nonlinear variables in the problem\nIndeed stay away from auxiliary variables for the equation if you want to rely on automatic differentiation\nFor the last item, you can do either. There are a suite of vector kernels that we use for Navier stokes with finite elements notably. It s a little more efficient to do this as there are 3x less kernels in 3D.\nThe solid mechanics module is not using vector variables though. So if you foresee reusing kernels or materials from that module then I would stick to component-wise.\nFor whether to use the solid mechanics module or not, you ll have to look if you want to use the way they compute stresses, the various strain-stress relations, the explicit time integration schemes for dynamics etc. There are numerous techniques in that module that would be quite some work to reproduce",

I used the debuggers on my old MacBook, I switched to ARM and now the debuggers won't work (error: failed to launch or debug process)\nIs this due to the ARM and x86 differences? When I start the debugger I do get this: Current executable set to '/Users/jean/projects/babbler/babbler-dbg' (x86_64).\nI still haven't found a workaround the initial error.\nThanks!",

I\u2019ve written the following code using AnnularMeshGenerator\n[Mesh]\n  [msh]\n    type = AnnularMeshGenerator\n    nt = 1000\n    rmax = 4.1e-3\n    rmin = 0\n    nr = 80\n  []\n[]\n\nHowever, this results in very small elements near the center and progressively larger elements as the radius increases. What I actually need is a uniform mesh throughout the domain, where I can specify the element size directly for instance 0.1mm in my case (as shown in the attached figure).\nIs there a way to achieve this in MOOSE? Any suggestions or alternative mesh generators that would work better?\nThanks in advance!",
