          "bodyText": "I was modeling a full core with hundreds of 1D flow channels by using THM. Firstly, I found THM needs a long time to initialize setting up, and the consuming time increases greatly with used number of threads.\n\nBesides, the initialization time increases slightly with used number of processors.\n\nThen, I tried to run this simulation with the command line of \"mpiexec -n 4 ......\". But I encountered an error with \"EXIT CODE: 9\" which was caused by out of memory. The computing machine is WSL with 32 GB RAM and one Intel Ultra 9 CPU. The number of DOFs of nonlinear system and auxiliary systems are 27,360 and 110,580 respectively. It seems small and should not exceed memory requirement.\n\nWhen I used 1 or 2 processors with a single thread, the simulation was passed both with a consuming memory of about 5 GB. It seems conflict with the mentioned error by using 4 processors.\nIs it possibile to effectively model hundreds of 1D flow channels by THM?",

I have run into slowdowns when trying to run larger simulations, so I have tried to profile my code using gperftools and pprof. The only hiccup I had in the installation process was updating and rebuilding libmesh. When running that script, I got the following error:\n(moose) harrysmith@Harrys-MacBook-Pro moose % scripts/update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh\nERROR: LIBMESH_DIR=/Users/harrysmith/miniforge/envs/moose/libmesh exists within the conda base /Users/harrysmith/miniforge\nExiting in order to stop you from overwriting your conda environment\n\nI proceeded without rebuilding libmesh and I was able to compile and run in oprof mode. I successfully got the profile .prof files out, but I am getting this error when I try to use pprof to read the profiles:\n(moose) harrysmith@Harrys-MacBook-Pro run_4 % pprof run4_0.prof \nLocal symbolization failed for libresolv.9.dylib: stat /usr/lib/libresolv.9.dylib: no such file or directory\nSome binary filenames not available. Symbolization may be incomplete.\nTry setting PPROF_BINARY_PATH to the search path for local binaries.\nFile: libvtkIOLegacy-9.2.9.2.5.dylib\nType: cpu\n\nI can still see some of the MOOSE framework functions when I use top, but most of the function run time is clumped under libresolv.9.dylib , making this profiling tool largely unhelpful:\nShowing top 10 nodes out of 168\n      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%\n    33.62s 92.82% 92.82%     36.22s   100%  [libresolv.9.dylib]\n     0.30s  0.83% 93.65%      0.30s  0.83%  RankFourTensorTempl::operator*\n     0.18s   0.5% 94.15%      0.32s  0.88%  RankTwoTensorTempl::times\n\nI have tied setting PPROF_BINARY_PATH to the path of the oprof executable file, but that did not help. I found this missing libresolv.9.dylib file online, put it in my project directory, and tried setting PPROF_BINARY_PATH to the path of that file. I got the same error after trying that. Lastly, I have also tried removing my Conda environment and gperftools and reinstalling them without any luck.\nI am running this on an Apple Silicon Mac, but I have also tried running this on WSL and got the same missing file error. Thank you in advance for your time and help.",

I intend to fix $u_x = u_y = 0$ along the left boundary.

I inspected the BCs system, but I can't find anything that accomplishes what I want (I'm guessing there is a solution, but I can't find it as I'm relatively new to solving 3D linearized-elasticity PDEs, and I am still learning about the stress tensor $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$). Come to think of it, I don't really understand what something like $\\mathbf{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ means, given that $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ is a 3x3 matrix and $\\mathbf{n}$ is a vector (i.e., how do we compute a dot product between a matrix and vector)?

My understanding was that a traction boundary condition is represented by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In my case, $\\mathbf{F_1}$ is a traction boundary condition, where $\\mathbf{F_1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 5000000N$.\nBut if the above is true, ConstantRate seems to apply $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = c$ (i.e. the time-derivative of the displacement-vector), whereas I want a spatial derivative, since $\\sigma_x = E\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}$, where $E$ is Young's Modulus? Thus, I'm not convinced that the ConstantRate approach correctly implements these equations since a time derivative is involved?\nNOTE: $\\mathbf{F_1}$ and $\\mathbf{F_2}$ are meant to represent contact forces acting on my square. Eventually, I want to perform an FEA solve on the 3D cube seen below, which is simulated in a physics simulator. My ultimate goal is to be able to perform a solid mechanics FEA solve on any arbitrary geometry by (a) simulating it in a physics simulator and (b) reading in the observed contact forces applied at different points/nodes on my mesh as traction BCs applied in MOOSE (so I don't want to have the force spread out, but rather applied at the points observed in the physics simulator).\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n    box_falling.mp4",

Or in this case, since the forces are only acting locally on the individual voxels at the corners, do I divide these forces by the volume of the individual voxels? My understanding is that the body forces $\\bf{b}$ must have units of force/volume so they must be divided by some kind of volume - but I'm unsure which kind in this case?",

It s something that can be changed with enough development work\nGuillaume",
