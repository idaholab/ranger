          "bodyText": "First, thank you for providing such detailed documentation and examples for mixed-dimensional modeling. While implementing both DFN and CDFM models, we noticed some interesting behavior regarding property scaling that we'd like to discuss.\nWe're working with the example Flow and solute transport along 2D elliptical fractures embedded in a 3D porous matrix as a reference and implementing similar models. The documentation suggests scaling both permeability and porosity with aperture:\n[Materials]\n  [poro1]\n    porosity = 6e-4   # = a * \u03d5\n  []\n  [permeability1]\n    permeability = '1.8e-11'   # = a * k\n  []\n\nObservations\nWe've tested different scaling approaches and observed the following:\nConfiguration A (Double scaling as suggested in documentation):\nk = (a\u00b2/12) * a  # Permeability scaled with aperture\n\u03d5 = 1 * a        # Porosity scaled with aperture\nResults:\nDFN model:\n\nExtremely rapid pressure propagation\nConvergence issues even with very low injection rates (e.g., 2e-7 kg/s)\nNearly instantaneous equilibrium regardless of injection rate\n\nCDFM model:\n\nMore stable behavior\nDifferent pressure propagation compared to DFN\n\nConfiguration B (Single scaling):\nk = (a\u00b2/12) * a  # Permeability scaled with aperture\n\u03d5 = 1            # Unscaled porosity (MOOSE handles volume scaling)\nResults:\nBoth DFN and CDFM models:\n\nStable convergence\nPhysically reasonable pressure propagation\nGood agreement between models (2-5% deviation)\nExpected sensitivity to injection rates\n\nQuestions\nGiven that MOOSE automatically scales the volume term (and thus porosity) with aperture for lower-dimensional elements, is the additional manual scaling of porosity necessary or potentially problematic?\nThe observed behavior suggests that Configuration B (scaling only permeability) produces more physically reasonable results. Is this the intended approach?\nCould the documentation be clarified regarding:\n\nThe automatic scaling performed by MOOSE\nWhich properties need manual scaling and why\nThe physical interpretation of single vs. double scaling\n\nAdditional Context\nOur testing involved:\n\nModel domain: 100m \u00d7 100m \u00d7 100m\nAperture: 6e-4 m\nMatrix permeability: 1e-22 m\u00b2\nVarious injection rates from 2e-7 to 20 kg/s\nBoth pure DFN and CDFM implementations\nPorousFlowSquarePulsePointSource\nWe're happy to provide additional details or test cases if helpful.",

          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE experts,\nAfter MOOSE update, I keep getting an error when I run my models with gmsh file, which did run well without any problem before. While I was testing with a simple model with a squared domain including a circle in the middle, I found out that the model runs with coarse mesh at the boundary of a sideset block. But when I increase the number of nodes at the sideset boundary, it makes an error regarding the mesh. And the similar error appears when I run my models, which worked fine before.\nCould you help me with the issue? Please find the error, mesh file script and input file below.\nMany thanks\n*** ERROR ***\n$Elements dim 2 element 4279 (entity 2, TRI3) has node at   Node id()=204, processor_id()=4294967295,

I have set two surface entities to separate them into two blocks for different physics in MOOSE. So I need the elements outside of the circle boundary in the box to be still in the domain block having different physics from the ones in the circle. Also what could be the reason that this problem did not appear with the same mesh before I updated MOOSE? Could this be ignored if the node lies at the boundary for an older version?",
