Is there a way to write it without Einstein's notation? I looked up a lot of data, the weak form of the mechanical equation will use a lot of matrix expression, look not concise enough.",

Shouldn't the return type be VectorVariablePhiCurl instead?\n\nThis is from MooseTypes.h\ntemplate <typename OutputType>\nstruct OutputTools\n{\n  typedef typename TensorTools::IncrementRank<OutputType>::type OutputGradient;\n  typedef typename TensorTools::IncrementRank<OutputGradient>::type OutputSecond;\n  typedef typename TensorTools::DecrementRank<OutputType>::type OutputDivergence;\n\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputType> VariableValue;\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputGradient> VariableGradient;\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputSecond> VariableSecond;\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputType> VariableCurl;\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputDivergence> VariableDivergence;\n\n  typedef typename Moose::ShapeType<OutputType>::type OutputShape;\n  typedef typename TensorTools::IncrementRank<OutputShape>::type OutputShapeGradient;\n  typedef typename TensorTools::IncrementRank<OutputShapeGradient>::type OutputShapeSecond;\n  typedef typename TensorTools::DecrementRank<OutputShape>::type OutputShapeDivergence;\n\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShape>> VariablePhiValue;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeGradient>> VariablePhiGradient;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeSecond>> VariablePhiSecond;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShape>> VariablePhiCurl;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeDivergence>> VariablePhiDivergence;\n\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShape>> VariableTestValue;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeGradient>> VariableTestGradient;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeSecond>> VariableTestSecond;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShape>> VariableTestCurl;\n  typedef MooseArray<std::vector<OutputShapeDivergence>> VariableTestDivergence;\n\n  // DoF value type for the template class OutputType                                                                 \n  typedef typename Moose::DOFType<OutputType>::type OutputData;\n  typedef MooseArray<OutputData> DoFValue;\n  typedef OutputType OutputValue;\n};\nInstantiating OutputTools<VectorValue<Real>> results in typename OutputTools<VectorValue<Real>>::VariablePhiCurl corresponding to a MooseArray<std::vector<VectorValue<Real>>> which is the equivalent of the VectorVariablePhiCurl. This is the typedef in MooseTypes.h:\ntypedef typename OutputTools<RealVectorValue>::VariablePhiCurl VectorVariablePhiCurl;",

I'm sure that causes some confusion and I'm sorry about that!\n\nWe are looking into implementing RT elements for vector-valued problems\n\nThat would be awesome. I would love to see that. Have you looked at libMesh which is our underlying finite element library? That's actually the place where a new basis implementation would go and then it would propagate down into MOOSE\n\nwouldn't through up an error for Real types (or is there divergence for scalar field)?\n\nNo it would not. There is not really a divergence for a scalar field. We could consider doing some refactoring in our variable classes that remove curl and divergence code for all but the vector template instances. However, we just haven't had a need motivating that change.\n\nDo templates in general get initiated for all types or only the specific case it is invoked for (i.e. VectorValue)?\n\nThey are only instantiated when used (implicitly) or when explicitly instantiated. For instance at the bottom of MooseVariableFE.C we perform some explicit instantiations:\ntemplate class MooseVariableFE<Real>;\ntemplate class MooseVariableFE<RealVectorValue>;\ntemplate class MooseVariableFE<RealEigenVector>;",

          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE community\nI'm encountering an issue with setting a dynamic CSV file as a Boundary Condition (BC) in my application. In my setup, I'm using a FunctionDirichletBC that calls a function of type PiecewiseConstant, and this function is configured to read data from a CSV file. The challenge is that this CSV file is expected to change over time during the simulation.\nI've implemented an external code that appends a new row to the CSV file after each time step of the MOOSE simulation. However, my MOOSE-based application appears to only consider the initial version of the CSV file before the start of the simulation and doesn't recognize its dynamic changes during the simulation.\nI attempted to address this issue by changing the execute_on option in the Function block to \"TIMESTEP_BEGIN,\" with the expectation that MOOSE would recognize the updated CSV file at the beginning of each timestep. Surprisingly, this approach didn't yield the desired results. Strangely, the behavior remains the same whether the execute_on option is set to \"none\" or \"TIMESTEP_BEGIN.\"\nTo be clear and concise, I would greatly appreciate any insights into how MOOSE handles the variations in a CSV file during a simulation. What methods or configurations can be used to ensure that MOOSE recognizes and applies the changes in the CSV file during the simulation?\nThank you for your assistance.",

These initially state the use of 1 node and 24 cpu, however, each calculation by the quadrature sample is run with 'Num Processors:1, Num Threads:1'.\nIs this a bug or a feature?

The TestHarness does invoke the TestHarness again. But in a very controlled way. The fact remains this is not supposed to be the responsibility of the user.\nWhat you should do instead (but there may be caveats in your case):\nhead_node> ./run_tests --pbs my_run \\\n  --spec-file path/to/1000_job_test_spec_file \\\n  --pbs-node-cpus 48 \\\n  --pbs-project gtvb_job \\\n  --pbs-pre-source /path/to/env_profile # a bash/sh profile that performs `module load use.moose moose-dev`\nThis will create a PBS Script, and launch it via qsub.\nThe TestHarness will figure out how many nodes it needs based on the maximum discovered core count requirement among all jobs in a single test spec file (min_parallel = ) divided by supplied --pbs-node-cpus argument. So in order for the TestHarness to create the same PBS submission script you supplied, somewhere among your 1000 job test spec file you will need a job asking for a minimum of 240:\n[Tests]\n  [test_1000]\n    min_parallel = 240\n  [../]\n[]\n\nWhere the TestHarness isn't cool... is if among your 1000 jobs you have jobs only asking for 1 core, or 2, or anything less than 240, weird 'stuff' is going to happen:\nThe TestHarness being Python based, is only scalable to about 12 simultaneous jobs. So however you end up divvying out jobs, if the TestHarness begins to track the goings-on of more than this, you'll start to see a performance drop.\nBasically, if the TestHarness ends up running -j 240, and in turn actually launches 240 single jobs, I cannot say how efficient that will be.\nThe bottom line, I would have each job in your 1000 job test spec file contain min_parallel = 240. This of course will mean each job (all 1000 of them) will run serially.\nI hope this made some sense. I'd be happy to go into more detail!",

I found a few things while trouble shooting.\nThis is what I submitted:\n'/home/vandgavi/projects/bison/./run_tests' --pbs testing --spec-file /home/vandgavi/inputs/fp/di/testing_3 --pbs-node-cpus 48 --pbs-project ne_ldrd --pbs-pre-source /home/vandgavi/.bash_profile\n\n--pbs $name this will create an output file where your run tests file is $name.\n--pbs-project $project required for project.\n--spec-file this is where the disconnect begins. I tell ./run_tests to run my testing_3 spec file and it creates a $test_name.qsub script within the specified folder:\n#!/bin/bash\n#PBS -N params-di_1\n#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=24\n#PBS -l walltime=00:06:00\n#PBS -P ne_ldrd\n\n#PBS -j oe\n#PBS -o /home/vandgavi/inputs/fp/di/qsub.output\n#PBS -l place=free\nsource /home/vandgavi/.bash_profile || exit 1\nJOB_NUM=${PBS_JOBID%\\.*}\n\nexport MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=0\n\ncd /home/vandgavi/projects/bison\n/home/vandgavi/projects/bison/run_tests -j 24 --pbs-node-cpus 48 --pbs-project ne_ldrd --pbs-pre-source /home/vandgavi/.bash_profile --spec-file /home/vandgavi/inputs/fp/di/tests -o /home/vandgavi/inputs/fp/di --sep-files\n\nThere are a couple things to point out here and other tests I tried.\nThe walltime requested is a sum of each max_time in the script, for example, my testing spec has 3 tests each with 120s max_time. Results in walltime=00:06:00.  The sum of max_time's within the spec can NOT exceed the max wall time of 168 hours, it will request over maximum. @milljm this may be something you could fix in the same issue, I am not sure.\nThe next is that if the outputs of this script are present, it will automatically skip all the tests. if you wish to re-run this same test, all outputs must be deleted, i.e. the $test_name.qsub and $name files in their respective folders mentioned earlier.\nThis is something I call a bug, however, it may be a feature. The created .qsub file contains the line:\n--spec-file /home/vandgavi/inputs/fp/di/tests\nThis is wrong, even though my initial ./run_tests command includes the name of my spec as testing_3 it instead ran my tests spec which only checks input syntax. For now you must name the spec file you want to run, tests. Which throws a wrench in my plans as I have roughly 70 spec files with different names I'd like to use.\nThe first test in the script will be the name that shows up within the \"Active Jobs\" tab. This will show that only one job is running, however, the output shows that all three are running at one after another.\nWithin each test block in the spec file min_parallel = # must be specified or it will run on one cpu. The min_parallel=# divided by --pbs-node-cpus # will show up in the -j # of the $test_name.qsub file above. It will ask for the right number in the $test_name.qsub, however, when it trys to cue the job with those resources, it says there are \"insufficient slots\". For example, it will cue 2 nodes 96 cpu, the tests with min_parallel=96 will fail and it will say insufficient slots. Right now it seems like it can only use 1 node 48 cpu.\nAt this point, I'm not sure I can use Test Harness with MPI on the HPC.",

I don't think that is the case, but now it's got me wondering. @gambka, is this the issue you are concerned with (the additional questions about parallel_scheduler = true?\nI am heading home for the day, and will address the rest tomorrow!",

Is this some script in MOOSE somewhere?\nI think the only way to handle the wall time is going to be through an additional parameter. A global one:\n[Tests]\n  parallel_scheduling = True\n  walltime = 5:00:00\n  min_parallel = 240\n  [test1]\n    max_time = 60\n    min_parallel = 48\n  []\n  [test2]\n    max_time = 60\n    min_parallel = 48\n  []\n  [test3]\n    max_time = 60\n    min_parallel = 48\n  []\n[]\n\nIf what I want to implement, is implemented, the idea is that 5 jobs would run simultaneously (-j 240 / 48 = 5), and all the jobs contained in this spec file need to finish within 5 hours.
