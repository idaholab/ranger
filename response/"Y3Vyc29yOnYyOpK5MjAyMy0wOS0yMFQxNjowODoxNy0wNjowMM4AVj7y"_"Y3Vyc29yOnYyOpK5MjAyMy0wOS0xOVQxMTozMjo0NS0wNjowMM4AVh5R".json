So, I cannot override it in the derived class. Most of the other functions in this class are virtual. Is there a reason why 'computeContactForce' is not a virtual function? If this could be made a virtual function, it will be helpful in further development of this constraint class.",

My most recent problem that I can't overcome is that when I try to build MOOSE following the steps in Conda MOOSE Environment (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/conda.html) I get a fatal error. Please see below.\ncd ~/projects/moose/test\nmake -j 6\n\nI tried running the command\ncd ~/projects/moose/test\nmake -j 4\nand I got a successful build but then the test failed\ncd ~/projects/moose/test\n./run_tests -j 6\nwhether I ran -j 6 or -j 4. These are some examples of the failed tests.\n\n\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.",

If you have need of building your own (if you wish to develop your own MOOSE based application), you instead want to install moose-dev. This package installs everything necessary for moose development.\nYou can have both, but you should not use the same Conda environment for both. Example of installing both:\nmamba create --name moose_development moose-dev\nmamab create --name moose_binary moose\nWith two Conda environments available, you can now:\n\n\nI want to build my own special application:\nmamba activate moose_development\ncd /some/directory/my_app\nmake\n./my_app-opt -i some_input.i\n\n\nI want to just run a simple problem input file I have:\nmamba activate moose_binary\nmoose -i some_input.i\n\n\nI realize we make use of the same Conda environment name \"moose\" among our instructions.
