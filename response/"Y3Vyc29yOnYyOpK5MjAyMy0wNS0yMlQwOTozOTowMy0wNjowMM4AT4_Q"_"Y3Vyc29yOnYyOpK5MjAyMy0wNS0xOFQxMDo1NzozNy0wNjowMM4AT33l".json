I suspect this isn't the main error as moose/libmesh is completely empty.\nMake eventually spits out the following error:\nmake: *** [/path_to_moose/moose/framework/build.mk:149: /path_to_moose/moose/framework/build/unity_src/src_Unity..opt.lo] Error 127\nPoking around in the .mk file lead me to believe that it would take far too long to fix whatever was causing this error. I don't have any experience in C, so I apologize for any lack of knowledge in advance. I've had a terrible time using make files no matter who the distributor, so it's likely I'm making a very common mistake.\nSteps to Reproduce\n-Install moose as described by install guide (except instead of ~/projects I used my own directory)\n-Run make -j 6\nImpact\nI can't install moose.",

In Griffin (previously, in Rattlesnake), we then just use a Steady executioner and solve for the fluxes (which the SPH or discontinuity factors are a by-product of).\nFor more complicated problems with tough convergence, it can be useful to first perform a few traditional SPH iterations (as described in Section 2.2.1 of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454917303079) to provide a good initial guess.

For example, a property that relies on a solution variable (e.g., thermal conductivity as function of temperature) will be computed with the current temperature during the solve iterations, so the properties are tightly coupled.\"\nThe overall approach is what I gathered from the \"Algorithm 2\" box in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454917303079\nI should mention that I only wanted to apply this to problems with vacuum boundary, so no normalization was required.\nI also didn't insert all necessary physical properties in the example I provided, just diffusivity and removal cross-section for simplicity, but clearly the real thing should also have the other parameters appearing in the multigroup diffusion equation.",

The nonlinear variables are indeed the fluxes (which is equivalent to solving for the SPH factors but with the advantage of having a very similar formulation when we compute and use the SPH factors).\nRegarding your implementation, I'm sure you can make it work that way but the trickiest part of the implementation is to make sure you can keep track of which reference flux goes to which part of the domain (at least if you are targeting large problems with lots of SPH regions). We use an extra element integer in the mesh to do that. Then you can have a single ElementUserObject performing the flux integration at each linear iteration over all the SPH regions.",

In the former, cross sections depends on SPH factors which depends on flux, thus we introduce nonlinearity in the residual evaluation, PJFNK is using Newton iteration to solve this nonlinear problem. In the later, Newton iteration is equivalent with SPH iteration, i.e. at each iteration or linear solve, SPH factors are fixed. If you do need to evaluate discontinuity factors on vacuum boundaries, you may want to consider using DomainUserObject so that you can put volumetric flux integration and surface partial current integration in one place.

I assume that having an extra evaluation at the beginning of each Newton iteration does not change things.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that this sets the all the FE coefficients for the first PJFNK iteration to 1.5?\n\nIt does set the initial values to the flux variables. The meaning of FE coefficients depends on the shape function family. For LAGRANGE, yes, all coefficients will be the values at the nodes, thus equal to 1.5. You can implement your own InitialCondition to use the reference flux to initialize the flux in a more sensible way. Or you can start from the simple initialization with few SPH iterations.\n\nIs there any reason not to do this?\n\nYou can use gperftools (MOOSE has a documentation page on how to do it) to do some profiling if performance is a concern. But I doubt this can cause issue.\n\nIf I want that I have to code it myself right?\n\nYes, if it is missing in MOOSE.
