          "bodyText": "Hello MOOSE Community,\nI'm de-bugging a model that simulates fluid injection through a 2D fracture embedded in a 3D volume, using a conforming mesh built in GMSH and converted to EXODUS format using MOOSE.\nI'm using PorousFlowSquarePulsePointSource block restricted to the fracture subdomain to simulate constant fluid injection at the center of the fracture. I've prescribed a large permeability contrast between the fracture and rock subdomains such that fluids should move along the fracture, with minimal to no fluid exchange into the surrounding rock domain.\nGiven this, I would expect the mass balance block restricted to the fracture subdomain should be abs(fluid_in - fluid_out) = inj_rate * dt\nHowever, the fracture mass balance is a little more than an order-of-magnitude less than injected mass per time step. In contrast, the block restricted mass balance in the rock subdomain is equivalent to the injected mass per time step. This makes me concerned that fluid is not being injected into the fracture subdomain, but instead into the rock.\nIs this expected behavior / something that I should not be concerned with? Is this the result of an error in meshing / input file on my part?\nI have a MWE at https://github.com/jrpatterson79/testing.git\nThanks in advance for any insights y'all might have\nJPatterson",

To answer your question, this behavior has been consistent moving from a coarse mesh to the currently more refined mesh. Refining the mesh even produces a minimal effect.\n@cpgr Reducing the porosity does diminish the effect, which makes sense. I've spent sometime re-reading the flow through fractured media page, and I'm wondering if there is an effect of the element shape / type. GMSH produces TRI3 elements for the 2D fracture surface. In contrast, the 3D example (coarse_3D.i) shows that the 2D fracture surfaces are TRISHELL3 elements, which appears to be an element type generated by CUBIT. Could this be contributing to the results I'm seeing? Is GMSH capable of generating this type of element? I have not found any helpful answers through internet searches or reading through the GMSH user manual",

Several kernels derived from Kernel were constructed for diffusion, collision, scattering and fission, and I verified the code by several eigenvalue problem benchmarks. Then I tried to expand it for transient problems. However, non-physical variable values (negative and asymmetry neutron fluxes) always occur.\nTo test the code, I designed a test case and tried to solve the neutron diffusion equation with Steady executioner in which a keff is fixed and comes from a reference solution. From my point, this equals to a time-step calculation in the transient problem. In the test case, the solution was converged but unexpected variable values were obtained. In a strange way, the correct solutions could be obtained by Eigenvalue executioner. The difference between the mentioned two calculation is mainly the implementation of Kernel for the fission source term in the neutron diffusion equation. I checked it carefully and no mistakes were found in the fission kernel.\nCould you give me some advice? Thanks for your help.",
