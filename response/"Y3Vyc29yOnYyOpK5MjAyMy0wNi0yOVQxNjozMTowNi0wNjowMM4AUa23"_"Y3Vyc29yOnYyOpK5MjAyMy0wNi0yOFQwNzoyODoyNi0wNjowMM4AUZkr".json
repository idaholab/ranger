          "bodyText": "The INS FE AD system produces velocity upshoots/downshoots at the outlet for pipe/channel flow under fully developed flow conditions.\nThis can be reproduced using the pipe flow test by refining the mesh (e.g., nx=800, ny=20), lengthening the pipe from 1m to 4m, and reducing the Reynolds number to 100 (for faster transition to fully developed flow).\nThe figure shows the x velocity from x=3m to 4m along y=0m. An upshoot appears near the outlet after a region of relatively stable fully developed flow.\n\nRefining the mesh near the outlet boundary does not help and may actually worsen the solution where the flow transitions from coarse to fine mesh regions, possibly due to reduced SUPG stabilization from the smaller mesh sizes.\nI can't figure out the numerical reasoning behind this behavior. Is there any way to suppress the upshoots/downshoots?",

Data members like _JxW always contains the right numbers; it just doesn't contain any derivative information for Jacobian computation. That's why we do the checks in the Jacobian computation. @eiloo was getting different answers because they were not setting use_displaced_mesh = true in the INSAD materials.\n\nAlso, I was wondering what's the difference between accumulating residuals using accumulateTaggedLocalResidual and _assembly.processResiduals\n\nThere is no difference in terms of results.

And by reading ElementPropertyReadFile.C, you will find that when nprop = 3, it is not necessary to use the last column of the input_file.txt file provided by moose.\n\n\nThis output seems the stress as a function of time. How can I get strain-time or strain-stress curve? what is unit for time?\n\n\nIn this way, using the Euler angle input file I just provided, simulate the uniaxial stretching of 200 grains, and finally get a file named prop_grain_read_out_xiu03.csv, which contains time(s), Lagrangian strain, and Cauchy stress. And you can output the stress-strain curve, as shown in the figure,\n\nAfter that, the unit system of the crystal plasticity module is mm-MPa-s. Please forgive me that I forgot the specific moose URL.\n\n\nHow can I check and visualize the generated mesh?\n\n\nFirst, moose has its own visualization software, peacock. Second, you can use paraview, a software to visualize the mesh you generate, which is also introduced on the moose website.\n\n\nAbout material definition, how can I define my own material property?\n\n\nDefining your own material properties may be more difficult than you think. You may need to refer to the existing material modules of moose and its introduction to writing C++ code in the introductory files. Please forgive me that I am currently trying to continue the modification of the material module, and I have no more experience to share with you. hi @jiangwen84 and @ngrilli, Would you have any good experiences to share in this regard?\nBest Regards\nWei",

          "bodyText": "Hello all,\nI am working on a recrystallization problem and noticed that the ACSEDGPoly kernel is heavily influenced by mesh adaptivity. The effect is seen in the GIF below, both cases are  a single circular grain in the middle of a large grain with high dislocation density. The Small grain grows due to the dislocation energy, as expected. However, when mesh adaptivity is on (top right) the circle grain becomes rapidly deformed and grows significantly slower compared to when the mesh stays uniform (bottom right). The contours just highlight the differences in the circular grains.\nThe input file for these cases is at the end of the post. If I comment out the ACSEDGPoly kernels and perform this test again then the results with and without mesh adaptivity are the same.\nCan anyone give insight into what is causing this behavior?\nThanks,\nFloyd\n\nfile = 'Stored_Energy_Adaptivity'\n\n[Mesh]\n  parallel_type = 'REPLICATED'\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n  dim = 2\n  nx = 50\n  ny = 50\n  xmin = -5e-4\n  xmax = 5e-4\n  ymin = -5e-4\n  ymax = 5e-4\n  elem_type = QUAD4\n[]\n\n[Adaptivity]\n  steps = 1\n  marker = gr1_mark\n  max_h_level = 1\n  initial_steps = 1\n  initial_marker = uniform\n  [Markers]\n    [gr1_mark]\n      type = ValueRangeMarker\n      variable = gr1\n      lower_bound = 0.01\n      upper_bound = .95\n    []\n    [uniform]\n      type = UniformMarker\n      mark = REFINE\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  op_num = 2\n  var_name_base = gr\n  enable_jit = false\n[]\n\n[UserObjects]\n  [grain_tracker]\n    type = GrainTracker\n    compute_var_to_feature_map = true\n    threshold = 0.2\n    connecting_threshold = 0.08\n    compute_halo_maps = true\n    remap_grains = true\n  []\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [IC_gr0]\n    type = SpecifiedSmoothCircleIC\n    variable = gr0\n    x_positions = 0\n    y_positions = 0\n    z_positions = 0\n    radii = 1e-4\n    int_width = 1e-5\n    invalue = 0\n    outvalue = 1\n  []\n  [IC_gr1]\n    type = SpecifiedSmoothCircleIC\n    variable = gr1\n    x_positions = 0\n    y_positions = 0\n    z_positions = 0\n    radii = 1e-4\n    int_width = 1e-5\n    invalue = 1\n    outvalue = 0\n  []\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [gr0]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n  []\n  [gr1]\n    order = FIRST \n    family = LAGRANGE\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxVariables]\n  [bnds]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n  []\n  [unique_grains]\n    order = CONSTANT\n    family = MONOMIAL\n  []\n  [T]\n    [InitialCondition]\n      type = ConstantIC\n      value = 1200\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [PolycrystalKernel]\n  []\n  # [PolycrystalStoredEnergy]\n  #   grain_tracker = grain_tracker\n  #   deformed_grain_num = 1\n  # []\n  [ACStoredEnergy_gr0]\n    type = ACSEDGPoly\n    deformed_grain_num = 1\n    grain_tracker = grain_tracker\n    op_index = 0\n    v = gr1\n    variable = gr0\n  []\n  [ACStoredEnergy_gr1]\n    type = ACSEDGPoly\n    deformed_grain_num = 1\n    grain_tracker = grain_tracker\n    op_index = 1\n    v = gr0\n    variable = gr1\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxKernels]\n  [unique_grains]\n    type = FeatureFloodCountAux\n    variable = unique_grains\n    flood_counter = grain_tracker\n    field_display = UNIQUE_REGION\n    execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_END'\n  []\n  [bnds_aux]\n    type = BndsCalcAux\n    variable = bnds\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [consts]\n    type = GenericConstantMaterial\n    #              J/m3   m          -

I was able to find a combination of the coarsen and refine values in the ErrorFractionMarker that maintains the correct shape for the growing grain, however its growth rate was significantly reduced. There seems to be a threshold for the coarsen value below which the behavior is consistent, however the refine fraction is more touchy. It seems that around refine = 0.7 I get the best behavior, lower will slow the growth more and there are some noticeable fluctuations, higher values cause faster growth but it is extremely erratic (as shown below).\nDo you have any suggestions about how to choose values for coarsen and refine? Also, do you have any other tips for how to improve the behavior, or what is the root cause for the high level of mesh adaptivity sensitivity?\nThanks again for your help!\nRed: Uniform mesh\nBlue: Refine = 0.4\nBlack: Refine = 0.7\nGreen: Refine = 0.99",

Did you ever try to check mesh size sensitivity on a uniform mesh prior to starting to add adaptivity? Just to make sure that the finest resolution you are using in the uniform mesh is actually fine enough to obtain a converged result. Maybe you need a finer mesh that would typically needed to resolve the interface width, which would normally be the limiting factor. This is all I can think of off hand...",

I also tried increasing the number of refinement levels for the adaptive mesh, up to having ~20 elements across the interface. In these adaptive cases the growth changes with any change to the adaptivity scheme, but the growth behavior remains erratic.\nWith regard to the dislocation stored energy driving force, I lowered the dislocation density until the circle grain no longer grew. Just above that, when the stored energy driving force is just slightly larger than the curvature driving force, the grain still grows erratically. So, the culprit does not appear to be a large difference in driving forces.\nOne other thing, @GiudGiud, has suggested that it could be due to a lack of conservation. Since dislocations are not conserved, and that determines the stored energy driving force, it's difficult to really investigate. The best I could think of was lower the phase mobility to where the grains no longer evolve, in this situation as the mesh adapts the integral of the dislocation density does not change. So, I don't believe the adaptivity is a source for non-conservation, but I am open to additional ways I could try to verify this.",

Traditionally, an ODETimeDerivative kernel is added for each of the species and each species' density is initialized. The ChemicalReactions block parses out the listed reactions as individual reaction kernels, which are quite similar to MOOSE's native & relatively simple Reaction kernels.\nI tried to implement a steady-solve for a two-reaction network for which the steady-state solution from a Transient solve is known and verified. However, my initial attempts result in the electron density 'e' plummeting many orders of magnitude and the ion density 'Ar+' remaining constant. Both of these should change but remain equal to each other.\nI believe my issue is one of applying ill-posed constraints on the values. The reaction-network used has a steady-state solution for 'e' = 'Ar+' that is equal to the ratio of the two rate coefficients with no dependence on the value of 'Ar'. A simple steady-state problem using diffusion on a 1D mesh seems to work just fine because the boundary conditions seem to provide sufficient constraints.\nYou can find the input file and associated data in my fork of crane -> branch : steady -> problems/steady/TwoReactionArgon.\nAny suggestions?\nThank you!",

I start with a coarse mesh and then refine it as shown below:\n  [gmg1]\n    type = AnnularMeshGenerator\n    nt = 40\n    rmax = 5.13\n    rmin = 4.75\n    nr = 2\n  []\n  [extrude1]\n    type = AdvancedExtruderGenerator\n    input = gmg1\n    heights = '1.225 0.05 1.225'\n    num_layers = '2 5 2'\n    direction = '0 0 1'\n  []\n  [sub]\n    type = SubdomainBoundingBoxGenerator\n    block_id = 5\n    block_name = 'ref'\n    input = extrude1\n    bottom_left = '-1.25 4.63 -1'\n    top_right = '1.25 5.63 10'\n  []\n  [refine]\n    type = RefineBlockGenerator\n    input = sub\n    block = 5\n    refinement = 2\n  []\n\n\nThis produces a cylindrical mesh. However, the issue is that the refinement interpolates points between nodes without knowledge of the original circular geometry, resulting in flat surfaces after refinement. I'm curious if there is a workaround for this or if I will need to try to generate this outside of MOOSE",
