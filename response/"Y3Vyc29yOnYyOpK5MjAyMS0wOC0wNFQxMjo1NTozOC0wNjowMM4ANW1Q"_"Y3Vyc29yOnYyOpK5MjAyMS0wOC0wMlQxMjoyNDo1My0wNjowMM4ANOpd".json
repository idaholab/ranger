The EBSDReader has no information (like Euler angles) on that new grain however, because it is not in the initial datafile.\nWithout seeing your input I must assume that you are using the EBSDReader as an euler_angle_provider. You need to create a new object derived from EulerAngleProvider and GrainDataTracker<T> that will work as your new grain tracker and Euler angle provider. In that class you can override the newGrain method to assign a new set of Euler angles to the new grain. You will also need to override getEulerAngles to return the angles from your EBSDReader (needs to be a parameter of this object) if the grain ID is below the getGrainNum() of the EBSDReader, and return your randomly created Euler angles otherwise.\nThe newGrain method you implement will automatically get called by the grain tracking system if a new previously unknown grain is discovered.\nNote that for now the new grain data cannot be connected to a previous grain, because currently we have no way of determining the pre-split grain ID. Maybe that is something we (or you) could work on (i.e to assign the split-off part the same orientation as the original grain).",

I should really add this to the documentation, https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/actions/PorousFlowBasicTHM.html , because it has tripped me up too.  Note the time derivative of BasicTHM is \\dot{P}/M, while the PorousFlowFluidMass is calculating \\phi\\rho - so there's no reason why the latter should be conserved.  Simply change PorousFlowBasicTHM to PorousFlowFullySaturated (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/actions/PorousFlowFullySaturated.html).\n@cpgr : this raises things that have been nagging me for a while.  The problem is in PorousFlowVolumetricStrain.  In that class we calculate div(velocity).\n\nAn immediate problem is that in RZ coordinates we miss the u_r/r term, ooops\nPerhaps we should just utilize the user's calculation of total_strain, ie, replace the appropriate lines by _vol_total_strain_qp[_qp] = _total_strain[_qp].trace(); and total_strain_increment = _total_strain[_qp] - _total_strain_old[_qp];.  The user has defined what they mean by strain, so why not use it?\nThe reason we calculate in the current way is so our Jacobian is exact, while if we use the user's total strain, how would we get the derivatives?  We need at least d(vol_strain)/d(grad(u)).\nIn various cases we've assumed d(vol_strain)/du = 0, but in RZ (with the u_r/r term) that's not true, boohoo, and probably the case in finite strain nightmare land too, that requires extending other classes\nWhat the heck is that consistent_with_displaced_mesh that i put in?  It obviously works, but i can't figure out why.",

          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI have generated a mesh using Cubit, and am currently in the process of writing an input file for Pronghorn (which uses MOOSE modules). The mesh mostly contains triangles (see Figure below).\nI have a list of instruments with positions in Cartesian coordinates, and would like to compare my simulation results (specifically, the variable T_solid) to the experimental data. The problem is that most of the locations of these instruments are not at nodes, nor situated on lines connecting two nodes. The imperfect solution would be to use NearestNodeNumber but it is giving me the following error:\n*** ERROR ***\nA 'NearestNodeNumberUO' is not a registered object.\nIf you are trying to find this object in a dynamically linked library, make sure that\nthe library can be found either in your \"Problem/library_path\" parameter or in the\nMOOSE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.\nI was wondering what the best approach to this would be, and which postprocessors (or userobjects) I should use, or what the issue is with using 'NearestNodeNumber'.\nThanks,\nJosh",

What Kernel computes v? As far as I can tell you need to compute a mobility property and it's derivatives w.r.t. all coupled variables. The mobility does not appear in the variational derivative in the CH equation, so its derivative w.r.t. to order parameter gradients should not matter, right?\nI also suggest you utilize the DerivativeMaterialInterface to declare and get derivative material properties for better interoperability with the rest of the phase field module.\nIn short, this should be really simple to implement with only a material for computing the mobility and simply using all stock split CH formulation kernels.",

          "bodyText": "My current work focus on modelling a material microstructure on an RVE and eventually embedding the homogenized behaviour of this model on to bigger component models in continuum scale. As a first step i am interested in applying peridoc boundary conditions to this RVE and i was exploring various methods available in MOOSE which can do that job. The AddPeriodicBCAction objects contain straight forward methods to apply this BC, however to my dismay, the results were not on the expected lines. All of the related methods (auto, translation, function transformation) were tried.\nAlternatively i tried an another route in the form of constraints which might as well model the periodic boundary conditions. This however does not allow me to reference the two pairs of edges participating in this model. Seems like the meshgenerator would either want one pair of edges to be defined or definition of \"final_generator\" parameter which i could not understand, especially for this single domain model.\nA look in to the test suite (/test/tests/mortar/periodic-value/gold) suggests that this approach might give closer results, provided we reference the boundaries to be matched correctly. Here is what i received.\n*** ERROR ***\nYour MeshGenerator tree contains multiple possible generator outputs :\n\"master_y and one or more of the following from an independent set: \"master_x, slave_y\"\n\nThis may be due to a missing dependency or may be intentional. Please select the final MeshGenerator in\nthe [Mesh] block with the \"final_generator\" parameter or add additional dependencies to remove the ambiguity.\nAs far my submodel is concerned it is a simple 2D square block with normal displacements constrained in two of the edges and displacement loads applied on the right edge. The application of PBC's must ensure that the displacements on the respective opposite edges are the same and that we get the simlar deformed profiles on these edges. At present i could not get the sort of behaviour one would expect realistically for this kind of model. e.g., similar to the results in the above folder. I really appreciate any suggestion or pointers in this regard, that would provide a solid start to the work. The attached files might give you an insight in to the schematic of the model, input structure and the results obtained so far.\n19072021.zip\nKind regards,\nArun",

This gives enough room for the model to deform in the loading direction preventing the RBM encountered earlier.\n\n\nI hope the BC applied in this manner mimics realistically the response obtained for an infinite body, while integrating the results with larger continuum models.\nKind regards,\nArun",

Please could you advise me whether \"GeneratedMesh\" is the only option to execute problems with PBC's applied in an automatic fashion? And offcourse, any suggestions to make the translational method to work would be much welcomed.\nAttached here is the ABAQUS mesh used for this model, if you would like to give a check.\ncube.txt\nKind regards,\nArun",
