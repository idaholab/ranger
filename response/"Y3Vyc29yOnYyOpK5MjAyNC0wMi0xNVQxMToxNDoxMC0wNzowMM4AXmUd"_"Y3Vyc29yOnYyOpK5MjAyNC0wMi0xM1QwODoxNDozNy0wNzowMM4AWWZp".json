          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nWe are working on coupling THM models of geothermal systems with earthquake models.\nIn the THM application (application Tiger https://github.com/Domino2022/Tiger, based on the moose framework), we are modeling fluid injection within a 3D reservoir including faults, which are lower-dimensional features defined in the mesh (e.g. allowing to model the enhance fluid diffusivity at the fault). The mesh is built with gmsh.\nWhen the conditions for an earthquake are reached, we pass the stress state to the external earthquake modeling software (a discontinuous Galerkin code, https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol) and model the earthquake. Fault slip during the earthquake leads to a displacement discontinuity across the fault and comes in pairs with a stress change within the volume, also discontinuous across the fault.\nCurrently, when porting back the stress change to the THM model through a SolutionUserObject, we get a smooth version of the discontinuity. Specifically, the tractions on the fault are wrong, because based on interpolated stress instead of calculated from the stress on the 2 sides.\nTo solve this problem, I would duplicate the fault nodes and triangles, to create \"split nodes\", and then glue them with a mortar element in the THM model. Do you think this would work?\nIs there an automated way to generate a duplicated internal surface with gmsh for mortar application?\nWould a EqualValueConstraint be sufficient to capture the discontinuity of the stress at the fault interface when retstarting moose?",

After many trials in different setups with different solvers and initial conditions I just can't get my solution to converge.\nHere is the main input file I'm currently using. The mesh is here and the two main Material objects are IceMaterial_u2 (with ice viscosity based on Glen's flow law relating the rate of deformation) and SedimentMaterial_u2 (constant viscosity for a start).\nI'm wondering if for instance the executioner used here is not appropriate to the situation and should be changed?\nThe setup consists in a glacier in contact with the ocean on its downstream boundary, sliding over a sediment layer and having a\nDirichlet boundary condition at the upstream boundary to account for the influx of ice further up glacier (1000 m.y-1 in the input file shared above). For such cases, we usually work with MPa a so that stresses are of the order of 1 MPa. I think my dimension analysis should be correct but maybe the convergence issue comes from this and I just can't find it out...!\nI'm using MOOSE through another fork that is up to date (and all tests pass):\nFramework Information:\nMOOSE Version:           git commit cee3f610f9 on 2024-01-25\nLibMesh Version:         \nPETSc Version:           3.20.1\nSLEPc Version:           3.20.0\n\nHere an example of run that never converges:\nTime Step 0, time = 0\n\nTime Step 1, time = 0.001, dt = 0.001\n\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\n\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 9.856816e+08\nCurrently Executing    Finished Computing Jacobian                                                          [  1.95 s] [  557 MB]\n      0 Linear |R| = 9.856816e+08\n      1 Linear |R| = 3.098366e+03\n 1 Nonlinear |R| = 9.856815e+08\n      0 Linear |R| = 9.856815e+08\n      1 Linear |R| = 3.704444e+02\n 2 Nonlinear |R| = 9.852308e+08\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

I realized I still couldn't reach convergence even on this very simple case. It hence looks like it's the convergence of the ice rheology itself (the physics behind has been proof-checked several times) that I'm struggling with more than the different setups I'm using.\nFrom there, I've been trying to:\n\nset ICs closer to the solution (no significant improvement on convergence)\nadd a strong diffusion term at the beginning of the simulation (converges well at the beginning, slowly increasing velocity in the ice slab, then converging harder and harder as the diffusion term fades, until it wouldn't converge anymore)\nadd mesh adaptivity in case the simple mesh needed refinement to converge (eg close to the base; but no significant improvement either)\nset a higher initial tolerance (both nl_rel_tol and nl_abs_tol are set to 1e-4 as you can see on the input file shared through the hyperlink above; but that didn't help either)\n\nWhat I find interesting is that when I set an initial ice viscosity of 0.3 MPa.a all over the ice slab (which could be a value we expect) then velocity and pressure are solved very easily. Once I turn off the viscosity dependence on strain rate (at the second time step), no convergence can be reached anymore...\nThank you a lot for your precious help on this!",

No derivatives there is normal,\nThe only other material property is then mu.\nmu does not depend on pressure, so you dont get an extra term in the Jacobian from that.

The ACGBPoly kernel implements the variational derivative of the last term in Equation (4) of that paper, which is mu* a_s * sum_i (c^2 * eta_i^2) (the mu comes from equation 3). For a particular Order parameter, say eta_1, the variational derivative of that term wrt eta_1 is 2 * mu * a_s * c^2 * eta_1. So that will be computed in the function computeDFDOP in the switch statement with case Residual. You will see c * c there for c^2 and _u[_qp] for eta_1 (the member variable _u represents the nonlinear variable for this kernel, which should be eta_1). The prefactor mult is computed as 2 * mu * a_s at the beginning of that function. The notation gamma is a bit confusing here because in the paper, it is used for interfacial energy, whereas in the code gamma is the prefactor for the eta_I^2 * eta_j^2 term (called a_GB in the paper).",

I have attempted to simulate different cases using your suggested approach, and the input file along with the results are attached. Unfortunately, the outcomes of these simulations are not aligning with my expectations. Even with a significant increase in injection pressure, it is not possible to reduce the permeability to low values like e\u221214 (even e\u221213 with higher flow rates like 50 L/s).\nThere is a clear discrepancy between the results of this input file and those obtained with other numerical tools. I hope you don't mind taking a look at them again. My main goal is to work with higher flow rates, ranging between 70-100 L/s, while maintaining permeability within the range of e\u221214 to e\u221213.\nArchive.zip\nKind regards\nMorteza",

Even if I don't set the pressure, it is not possible to go for low permeabilities like 1e-14. you can decrease the flow rate to very low values like 1-2 L/s.

This is expected when you lower the permeability. Your injection/extraction flux is significantly higher than your Darcy velocity, which can lead to convergence problems. Does that make sense?",

If you want to set the temperature you can use a Dirichlet BC at that node, look at  modules/porous_flow/test/tests/dirackernels/injection_production.i\nThe 3D model also doesn't make any changes because you need to distribute the extracted/injected flux through your well (nodes) with the .bh file. Otherwise, the result is the same as a single point node sink/sources.\nI suggest you take a step back, remove the thermal physics and line sinks, and only work with point node sink/sources. Once you are convinced your results make sense, you can add more complex physics",
