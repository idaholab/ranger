          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI recently wrote a MeshGenerator that stores some necessary information in the form of a vector. One of my UserObjects requires this information to perform specific operations. However, I cannot declare a vector variable in the input.i file to receive this information. Therefore, I am considering using actions to add both the MeshGenerator and UserObject and facilitate the exchange of information between them. My knowledge of actions is limited, and I have only attempted to use actions to add kernels and variables in the past. Now, I have three questions:\n1. Immediate Execution of Appended MeshGenerator:\nWhen using _app.appendMeshGenerator in the act() function, will the relevant MeshGenerator operations be executed immediately? Or does this function merely declare the MeshGenerator, postponing execution? I initially planned to call _app.appendMeshGenerator and then declare a vector object in the action to receive the needed information from the MeshGenerator, passing it to my UserObject. If the MeshGenerator is not executed immediately, how can I obtain the required vector information?\n2. Action Destruction after Task Completion:\nAfter an action completes all its tasks, is the action automatically destroyed?\n3.  MeshGenerator Lifetime when Declared in input.i:\nIf I choose to declare the MeshGenerator in the input.i file, will the MeshGenerator object be destroyed once the mesh generation is completed? This concern arises as I need to access the information saved by the MeshGenerator in the action, necessitating the continued existence of the MeshGenerator object when the action is executed.\nThank you in advance for your guidance and assistance.",

                  "bodyText": "Hello\nFirst, if you don't mind, let's make sure you actually need to do it this way.\nWhat is the size of this vector? Is this something that has a value for every element? (if so, a field variable makes more sense. If it s a vector of indices, extra element integer ids, stored on elements, also make more sense).\nHow big is this vector? Could it be defined in the input instead?\nDoes this vector depend on the output of the mesh generation process? Or does it guide the mesh generation process as well as the UO?\n\nNo appending mesh generators will only schedule it for execution when mesh generation happens. Calling meshgenerator::execute() executes the mesh generator but you should not do that outside of the mesh generation process.\n\nThe mesh generators are actually constructed and executed very early in the simulation. I think an Action would be a fine place to store the vector, as Actions are constructed early as well (unlike user objects)\n\n\nno the actions stick around. We have talked about destructing them but never did\n\n\nSame for mesh generators. We have talked about releasing that memory but have not done it\n\n\nGuillaume",

Since I also need to understand the adjacency relationships between different elements in the coarse mesh, I'm attempting to store this information in the form of a vector<vector<>> (where vector[coarse_elem_id][coarse_elem_side]=neighbor).\nPreviously, I considered saving the coarse mesh (thanks to your previous help, I learned that I can save the coarse mesh as well) and directly providing it to my UserObject. However, it seems that functions directly manipulating the mesh are member functions of MeshGenerator. Implementing this operation in the UserObject might require substantial modifications.\nCurrently, I have an urgent need, so I opted to use a vector to store this information, which is the most familiar and quickest approach for me. I modified the code of CoarseMeshExtraElementIDGenerator to help me extract this information from the coarse mesh. Therefore, this vector variable depends on the output of the mesh generation but has no influence to its execution.",

In practice, though, I don't think we have any test coverage of it (because our standard MeshRefinement usage does a number of smoothing steps which include one that restricts mismatch to one level between neighbors), so I wouldn't trust it before adding some analytic or manufactured tests.\nNote though that just because you see two levels of adaptivity difference across an edge doesn't mean there's more than one level of adaptivity difference across a face.  In 3D it's quite common for refinement to create multiple hanging nodes on an edge, because you commonly have 4 (or 5, or with tets 6 or more) elements around that edge, and so the coarsest of them might have neighbors' neighbors with 2 more levels of refinement or neighbors' neighbors' neighbors with 3 more levels of refinement.  We do have a decent amount of test coverage of these sorts of cases.\nWith a tet there's no way to create one hanging node on a face; one level of refinement between Tet4 gives you 3 hanging nodes on edges with 0 non-edge hanging nodes on the face interior; between Tet10 one level of refinement gives you 3 hanging nodes on coarse-face+fine-edges.  To create meshes with no more than one level of mismatch on a face, you just use the default libMesh settings; you have to set MeshRefinement::face_level_mismatch_limit() = 0 to get unlimited levels of mismatch instead.\nThe default libMesh setting for edge mismatch is unlimited, though.  MeshRefinement::edge_level_mismatch_limit() = 1 would be the option to use to change that.\nI'm not seeing any MOOSE interface to either setting, but it wouldn't be hard to add one if we wanted.",

You do not see any a priori specification that element A is a neighbor of element B.  This is an issue for a finite element code, which needs to know e.g. whether solutions are supposed to be continuous between those elements or are allowed to go discontinuous between them.\nWhat we have to do is reconstruct the element-to-element topology from the element-to-node topology.  If we see that side 1 of A has the same nodes (up to a rotation/flip) as side 3 of B, then we conclude that neighbor 1 of A is B and neighbor 3 of B is A.  All is well.\nIf we refine B, so now it has children B0, B1 ... B7, but we're using our own file formats so we still know that B exists and that it's the parent of those children, all is still well.  This is a non-conforming mesh, but it comes from a conforming mesh that we can reconstruct the topology of.  Since we still know that neighbor 3 of B is A, we can look at the 4 children on side 3 of B and we can determine which of those should also have A as a neighbor.  When we're looking at each of those children later we can then see that it has a coarser neighbor on that side, so we know to calculate constraint equations for the \"hanging node\" DoFs on that side created by the refinement.\nIf we refine B, but we then discard it because we're using a file format that only stores B0 through B7, all is now broken.  Literally, the connection between those elements is broken apart.  As far as that mesh reader is concerned, you have defined a slit mesh, which is a perfectly valid sort of mesh to create, so we will happily construct it for you to compute on.  We will then compute answers that will be correct for the slit mesh, and thus incorrect for the slit-free mesh you thought you were creating.  The hanging nodes in between the refined elements and their coarse should-have-been-neighbor will be free to vary unconstrained by the coarse element nodes around them, and the resulting solution will be a disaster.  If you're lucky it'll be an obvious disaster and you won't trust it; if you're unlucky the solution will look correct to the naked eye but will be like 10% off.",

This has little to do with the particular FE software because most of the computation cost of crystal plasticity is the material model and not the stress equilibrium calculation. You will find a similar computational time with Abaqus UMAT. All that said, the computational time is directly proportional to the applied strain magnitude. If you increase xm you will see you can adopt a larger time step and still get convergence. Also your maximum_substep_iteration is too large, keep it to 2 max and decrease the time step instead if you see unconverged steps.",
