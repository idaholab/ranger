          "bodyText": "Dear Moose community,\nI would like to simulate a material having anisotropic and spatially dependent elastic properties. In particular, let\u2019s take the transverse isotropic case. In \u201cComputeElasticityTensor\u201d, I need to specify C_ijkl = '1111, 1122, 1133, 3333, 2323\u2019. Let\u2019s suppose that I know how the 5 terms depend on (x, y, z) via 5 different functions of (x, y, z).\nIn practice, I am looking at the generalisation of the pair \u201cComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\u201d and \u201cComputeVariableIsotropicElasticityTensor\u201d to the case of anisotropic elasticity, but I could not find a \u201cComputeVariableElasticityTensor\u201d that generalises \u201cComputeElasticityTensor\u201d.\nComputeElasticityTensor expects C_ijkl supplied as a std::vector. I could not find a way to define such vector in terms of an array of functions each returning a double. Would this do the trick, and how do I achieve this?\nI also tried to define C_ijkl in a similar way as GenericFunctionRankTwoTensor is defined in the documentation:\n[./tensor]\n  type = GenericFunctionRankTwoTensor\n  tensor_name = function\n  tensor_functions = 'fcn_00 fcn_01 fcn_02 fcn_10 fcn_11 fcn_12 fcn_20 fcn_21 fcn_22'\n  outputs = all\n[../]\n\nBut could not find an equivalent such as \"GenericFunction\" array of doubles instead of a tensor.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\nThank you.\nLuca",

For instance, quoting from the current documentation on ComputeElasticityTensor, one can define:\n[./elasticity_tensor]\n#Material constants selected to match isotropic lambda and shear modulus case\ntype = ComputeElasticityTensor\nC_ijkl = '1022726 113636 113636 1022726 454545'\nfill_method = axisymmetric_rz\n[../]\nBut this does not work if I want the '1022726 113636 ... ' to be a function of (x, y, z), rather than a vector of constants.\nIn addition to being able to define a tensor whose components are functions, I would need to be able to pass this tensor to the C_ijkl parameter of ComputeElasticityTensor.\nThanks,\nLuca",

As such, it will be difficult for us to debug this problem.\nDepending how you installed things there might be a change that the you are running with one python (e.g., system python) but the bindings external libraries (VTK, Qt) were built with another (i.e., conda).

I tried to run peacock with both the test app and the ex01 app.  I followed the online documents maybe a month ago for miniconda.  Tonight I did a git clone and continued following the instructions, I double checked my terminal history to verify I didn't skip a step.  I've tried starting peacock through the PATH variable and with an absolute path to moose/python/peacock.  I am local on MacOS big sur 11.2.1.  The ex01 makes and iterates successfully.  I just did a pip install pyqt5 to satisfy peacock dependencies.  It begins opening a window before the very brief segmentation fault message comes back.",

I want to load a grain structure with the ebsd reader then model dynamic recrystallization using the Grain Tracker and Discrete Nucleation. Everything seems to progress fine until a nucleus meets the requirements to be remapped with the grain tracker, then an error is produced from the ebsd reader:\n\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the object \"ebsd_reader\", of type \"EBSDReader\".\nError! Index out of range in EBSDReader::indexFromIndex(), index: 10 size: 9\n\nThe system starts with 9 grains, adding a 10th grain breaks breaks the ebsd reader. Attached is a reduced input file based on the grain_tracker_ebsd test in the phase field module and the ebsd file from that test, which will produce the error. Hopefully combining these features is possible and I am just missing something, any help would be appreciated.\nFloyd\ngrain_tracker_ebsd_nucleation_error.txt\nebsd_9.txt",

Im gonna try installing conda again to fix this issue. I did see on the moose install guide that they still say conda when referring to a lot of things, which i think is a typo considering they moose now recommends a direct install of mamba.\nIs there a reason that moose now recommends directly installing mamba and not conda?",

That is, you are coupling the porous flow within your sample to some other physics that governs the fluid's physics in the atmosphere.  The rate of fluid transfer between the two obviously depends on the physics in the atmosphere.  So what is that physics?   You have to decide, and the above link gives you some suggestions.  For the type of problem that i'm often doing recently, i make a thin,  permeable layer and then use a PorousFlowOutflow BC, but in the past i've used the PorousFlowSink to good effect",

You might not have precise control over the angle though. Alternatively, you can derive from https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/ics/BoundingBoxIC.html and create a new initial condition.",

However, I see that the listed requirement is for the problem to be a scalar-valued linear steady-state PDE with a suitable affine decomposition, meaning a problem like A(mu) u = b(mu). I'd like to do this as an eigenvalue problem with fission, so a problem of the form A(mu) u = lambda B(mu) u - examples like this using POD/PGD have appeared in the literature, and I've implemented it outside of MOOSE.\nI understand this is not currently available functionality - before I go too deep down the rabbit hole of trying to make modifications on my branch (and likely getting it wrong right away)... is this feasible with the current implementation/is there any advice on where to start looking to make changes/additions?
