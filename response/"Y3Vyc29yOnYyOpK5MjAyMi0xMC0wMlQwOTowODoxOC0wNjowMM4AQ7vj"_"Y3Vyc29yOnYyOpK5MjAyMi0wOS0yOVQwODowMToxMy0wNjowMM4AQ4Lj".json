My fluid inner wall and solid outer wall share one boundary when modeling. Ideally, as the solid expands with temperature, the solid region deforms and the fluid region deforms with it:\n\nBut there are some problems in the simulation. Please see the image below. It appears that when the solid expands radially, the fluid region is not \"compressed\" radially. Rather, the expanded solid area covers a portion of the fluid area. I mean the flow channel is not actually narrowed because of the expansion of the solid:\n\nHow to make the boundary of a block change with the boundary of another block in MOOSE? In other words, how do I make the fluid region compress as the solid expands in MOOSE?",

You'll need something to advect the fluid mesh. If you only have displacements on the boundary, the fluid mesh will be largely incompatible and most likely you get negative Jacobians on elements next to the boundary.

          "bodyText": "Hi, I am re-opening here a topic from previous thread [#21038], which is still not totally solved. The last time I wrote, @WilkAndy [who previously also helped me; solved discussion #20139] was going on holidays and tagged @cpgr for this, who was helping me then. @cpgr helped me to get better tabulated EOS for water, but in the end he could not find the time to approach the real problem I\u2019m facing [which I understand, as the input file is pretty long], and he is likely on vacation now, as I can\u2019t see any activity from him in the last weeks?\nI need to conduct single-phase hydrothermal simulations of ocean basins [with geochemistry], which are mostly under the ocean but partially [the sides of the domain] subaerial. So, the shallow part of the subaerial domain [the part above sea level] will be unsaturated, and the rest of the domain saturated. Examples input files and expanded description of the real application are in [#21038], which is the first goal to solve, but here I\u2019ve done now a simpler setup which still serves to illustrate the basic problem.\nSo, I am trying to do a ThermoHydraulic [i.e. no solid mechanics] simulation of hydrothermal activity under the ocean, and I confess that I am still confused about how to properly setup the porepressure ICs & BCs and their relation wit the EOS:\n1]  In the online documentation for Mass density, it indicates that the sum of saturations equals 1, but I guess this is not the case for unsaturated flow, right? That is the saturation for a single-phase partially-unsaturated flow can go below 1, and there is no other phase to make this sum go up to one. Or am I missing something?\n2] This is a big scale model, and I am not modelling perched aquifers nor anything special in the subaerial part, which means that everything is considered an unconfined situation in a globally connected porous block. So, for the porepressure BCs I am indicating as reference a constant barometric pressure [one atmosphere] for the subaerial parts and one atmosphere plus the ocean for the submarine part [ocean is at y=0 here]. But I wonder if this is right. In my mind, this is clashing with the negative pressures that develop in the unsaturated part, as one atmosphere environmental pressure is in direct contact with highly negative pressures at the top subaerial part. Please could you indicate if this constant 1 atmosphere porepressure reference for the subaerial part makes sense for unsaturated conditions?  The unsaturated porepressure (of the relevant) phase at the boundary of the porous matrix are not equal to the external fluid pressure like this.\n3] Or does the above mean that to model everything as unconfined connected porous block does not make sense at all?\n4] If I understand it right, it is directly the porepressure the pressure that is considered for the fluid EOS, while for the unsaturated part the porepressure goes negative [and I have elevations of ~1 km above sea level, which lead to high negative porepressure values]. Does it make sense that these negative porepressures are used for the EOS? This implies that I need to extrapolate the tabulation toward highly negative pressure values, which seems to make the convergence very difficult. Would not make sense to truncate to 0 [or 1 atm] the negative porepressure values that are passed to the EOS?\nThe attached input file runs with a \u201csimple fluid\u201d, but using the tabulated EOS [which I have until 10 Pa, and can\u2019t see how lower that that is reasonable] gives straightaway the error:\n\u201cPressure -34511.9 is outside the range of tabulated pressure (10, 4.41e+08).\u201d\n5] Only in the case that this global unconfined simulation makes sense. How would one set adequate ICs for the porepressure to overcome the early lack of convergence by initial shocks?\n6] Regarding the documentation of PorousFlow1PhaseP, it says \u201cThis Material is used for the fully saturated single-phase situation where the porepressure is the primary variable\u201d. Is this a documentation error? I can\u2019t understand how it can be used for a fully-saturated situation, when it is used to compute saturation. Or I should not use this material for unsaturated conditions?\nAll in all, this setup does not converge and I am not finding how to solve it. Any suggestion on alternative setups to make this work would be great.\nAs an alternative to set everything as a connected porousblock, I\u2019ve tried to set up the parts above sea level as a non-PorousFlow block [one of the tests in #21038] as for our purposes it would be enough to have only thermal conduction in the areas above sea level, but this has not converged for me, creating shock temperature and porepressures at the interface between the bottom of the non-PorousFlow block and the \u201cconfined\u201d porous flow part  underneath [although I could be doing something wrong]\nI am pasting an image of the \u201csimple\u201d case I am trying to resolve now, and an input file.

                  "bodyText": "Hi @garciapintado , let me try to answer some of your questions...\n(1) You are correct about the saturations not summing to 1 in this special case (probably we should add a caveat in the doco).   Single-phase unsaturated flow is the only case where the saturations do not have to sum to 1.  In single-phase unsaturated flow, there is just one saturation, which is the water saturation in your case.  The \"other phase\", which is air in your case, is not modelled explicitly (ie, it never enters your input file) has saturation = 1 - water_saturation.  The reason you don't have to model it is that it is assumed to have zero viscosity and (magically) appear whenever you need it to, presumably from some infinite reservoir, which is the atmosphere in your case.  That is a pretty good assumption in the unconfined aquifer situation.\n(2) You are absolutely correct about the 1 atm air pressure.  That is correct in real life, to a very good approximation.  HOWEVER, single-phase unsaturated flow assumes that atmospheric pressure is at 0 pascals (this is just a convention, probably for historical reasons - it's quite convenient since you know positive pressure means fully saturated, while negative pressure means unsaturated).  So, the water pressure in unsaturated zones is negative (because of capillarity - you can find various articles on the internet re capillarity).  So your atm should be zero.  Your Ptop_sink BC then reads: \"if porepressure is positive at the topography, that is, the topography is fully saturated, then let water seep out at rate given by flux_function\".  This is standard: you are removing groundwater and it flows away as surface water.  Often, however, an evapotranspiration-like form is used (some examples are mentioned at https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/boundaries.html ) which is motivated by physical ET as well as providing superior convergence (because it is smooth, instead of the piecewise function you currently use).  I believe your Ptop_submarine_source should act as a source AND a sink, because groundwater can flow to and from the ocean, so i believe pt_vals and multipliers should be -1E9 1E9.  I believe that your Ptop_subaerial_source is not needed.  If you want to model rainfall, just use a uniform source with PorousFlowSink.  You should probably do this, because it's physically correct, and it will prevent grossly negative porepressures.\n(3) It makes sense.  I've done it many times.\n(4) You water properties at all P<0 should be equal to those at P=0.\n(5) Setting ICs is not easy when you have complicated topography, crazy zones of ET, rainfall, rivers, etc, some of which you have.  I usually set P = max(0, 10000 * y), then run for some long time to get a reasonable steady-state, save the result, then (using that save result) run an actual steady-state simulation and save that result, and use the final result in my actual simulation.  That's a real pain, i know, but with complicated situations it's impossible to know what the steady-state actually looks like, and it's often important to get correct steadystate in order to calibrate vs piezometers, flow gauges, baseflow measurements, and other observations.\n(6) That's a documentation error.  I really thought we'd fixed that, thank you for noticing it.  PorousFlow1PhaseP can be used for unsaturated flow (and saturated flow - it just computes saturation=1).\nBy the way, i doubt you need TVD stabilization here, and you could employ the PorousFlowUnsaturated Action to simplify your input file.

With a simple fluid there is no problem; it is the combination of unsaturated conditions in the top of the domain and the EOS that seems to prevent the convergence.\nAfter your indications, I\u2019ve modified the BCs so that now:\n\ntop submarine boundary: advection for mass and heat are now a sink+source PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink with continuous slope for the g(.) functions [if I understand it right, to use a halfGaussian would not help further now, as this is already smooth: g(.) has a constant slope over the expected pressure range]\ntop subaerial boundary: advection for mass and heat has now a source PorousFlowSink. Yes, the idea is to simulate a continuous rainfall-evapotranspiration input.\ntop all domain: conduction has sink+source PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink, whose derivate is not continuous at pt_vals=0.\natm=0 now\n\nI\u2019ve played with some parameters [the rainfall-evapotranspiration flux; permeability in the shallow subaerial. The input is perhaps a\nbit better than the previous test [the development of the unsaturated area seems more stable for the simple fluid in the long term].\nI\u2019ve loaded now to GitHub the new tests:\n\n\narchaea01d.i :  converges well for simple fluid. Does not converge with tabulated EOS [via CoolProp; python script and file \u201cwater_IAPWS.csv\u201d], nor tabulated+extrapolated to negative pressure with 0-slope EOS [R script and \u201cwater_IAPWS_extrap.csv\u201d], nor with the [likely naive] modified PorousFlowSingleComponentFluidTruncated.\n\n\narchaea02d.i: attempt to continue the archaea01d.i run [after 10000 year to allow it for reaching an ~equilibrium with the simple fluid], but with any of the 3 above EOS options. Again, none works.  It works, though, with the simple fluid.\n\n\nIn all cases, I\u2019ve tried with both KT advection and full unwinding. The tabulated EOS water_IAPWS.csv did work  in fully saturated tests [see first plot in discussion #21038 where @cpgr helped me]\nI\u2019d find it hard to believe that MOOSE-PorousFlow would struggle with this single-phase problem. There must be something wrong in my input files that remains elusive to me and is driving me nuts. Please. would it be possible for you to try to run these tests to see if they work for you?\nFiles are at https://github.com/garciapintado/MOOSE_porous_flow_stuff\n\nMOOSE input at folder: central_valley_one_phase_tri6\nEOS tabulation script and results at folder: water95\n\n\u2014\nBTW: unrelated.

Probably it won't make a difference, but it's worth checking.\ni'm a bit worried about your PorousFlowSingleComponentFluidTruncated.  I believe it will assume the derivative calculations assume a linear extrapolation, and i'm not sure you've done that.  Possibly this is unimportant, since you don't seem to use PorousFlowSingleComponentFluidTruncated.\nI'm a bit worried about your R-script.  Are you assuming zero slope for P small?  If so, then MOOSE may experience crappy convergence.  The problem might be that if density, viscosity, etc, don't depend on porepressure, then MOOSE can (kind of) choose any porepressure at all - there isn't a unique solution.  (I write \"kind of\" because there are other constraints on porepressure, but perhaps you understand?)  It would be better to follow the \"SimpleProperties\" approach, where density varies a little with porepressure (perhaps exp(P/bulk_modulus), depending on how low P goes, because you don't want unphysically unrealistic density), pressure-independent viscosity, pressure-independent internal energy, etc.\nThanks for noticing the typo.",

I am on vacation abroad with only a few hours per day internet access in a public library, and have had to install some stuff [matlab, SEACAS\u2026] in a laptop.\nI\u2019ve pushed into the repository the file mesh_000000.mat, containing the exported MATLAB mesh, and a script I prepared matlabMesh2Exodus.py to export it into an ExodusII file, as input to MOOSE. The python script depends on the SEACAS library [in the case you don\u2019t have it installed, only the Exodus library with manual editing of the path to netcdf in the cmake-exodus file is needed], which I found in the web [I am unaware about alternatives for exporting a mesh from Matlab to Exodus]. It can be run as:\n$python3 matlabMesh2Exodus.py mesh_000000.mat 1\nThis will generate mesh_000000_exomerge.e. Hope that with this you can run the test, and it is not too bothering.\nAbout fluid properties, yes definitely the standard simpleFluidProperties object does not develop the convection [as we have seen in earlier -fully saturated- tests].  Previously, I also did tests for linear vs second order triangular elements, and I saw that with FIRST order elements, some [fully saturated] simulations were able to converge, while they failed for the SECOND order elements; normally after been able to run some time steps.\nSo, about the EOS for negative pressure, if I\u2019ve understood it right, your advice [@WilkAndy] is to do a 0-slope extrapolation for viscosity, internal energy, enthalpy\u2026], and an exp(P/K) extrapolation towards negative pressure for density [please, correct me otherwise]. With that, I\u2019ve done so by extrapolating from the CoolProp generated tables. This [plus the plot below] can be reproduced by running the sequence of files in the water95 folder:\n$python3 water95.py\n$Rscript extrapolate_EOS.R\n$python3 plot_IAPWS.py\nAlong the way, a doubt that has arisen to me is about your indication that PorousFlow uses 0 as atmospheric pressure. If so, then somewhere in PorousFlow is one atmosphere added to the pore pressure for the calculation of the fluid properties? I am wondering because I just noticed yesterday that CoolProp density values for 1 Pa that I was considering [before the extrapolation by the R script] are very low:\n'pressure' 'temperature' 'density'\n1      273.17 7.931927e-06    # from CoolProp\n100000      273.17 9.998438e+02    # from CoolProp [~1 atm]\n1000000      273.17 1.000301e+03    # from CoolProp\n\u2026\nPerhaps this was a source of problem [and even more if PorousFlow considers 0 as atmospheric pressure and the one atmosphere is not added when the tabulated EOS are obtained?]. I've also seen that a sharp jump in density is created by CoolProp for P values lower than 1e6 Pa and low temperatures. Thus, to decrease the severity in the Newton problem you mention [@cpgr], I have regenerated the tabulated EOS by using CoolProp only up to a minimum 1e6 Pa, and then extrapolating [by extrapolate_EOS.R]. For example, at 273.17 K, this now results in:\n'pressure','temperature','density\u2019\n-34900000     273.17  982.948118   # R script: extrapolated by exp(P/K)\n\u2026\n-14000000     273.17  992.826911   # R script: extrapolated by exp(P/K)\n-9000000      273.17  995.312083   # R script: extrapolated by exp(P/K)\n-4000000      273.17  997.803476   # R script: extrapolated by exp(P/K)\n1000000      273.17 1000.301106   # from CoolProp\n\u2026\nThis leads to the plot:\n\nI don't know how much physical sense this makes, but at least no extremely low density values appear and the strongest gradients are prevented.\nI've also included an archaea01d_tri3.i input file, removing the SECOND order stuff.\nUnfortunately the installation of MOOSE is failing in my laptop [at mamba install moose-tools moose-libmesh], and I haven't been able to run by now the tests again with this new water_IAPWS95_extrap.csv file.",

          "bodyText": "As mentioned in my other thread here #22020, I am working on implemented formulations for interface methods that require couplings to scalar variables. One currently published method is for weakly imposing periodic boundary conditions through surface integrals on opposing sides of the unit cell / RVE / microstructure; you can use either penalty, Nitsche, or Lagrange multiplier (mortar) approaches for this. This can provide benefit versus the HomogenizationConstraintScalarKernel MOOSE system because the DOF coupling is only on the external surfaces rather than every quadrature point through the material model. In the case of PCG iterative solver, solutions can be obtained WITHOUT preconditioning in a <1000 iterations for a 45,000 DOF system Jacobian.\nAfter scouring the framework source, I have found that most objects besides the Kernel do not have implementations of the off-diagonal coupling with scalar variables (which is the holder for the macroscale, volume-averaged quantity). More importantly, the assembly tagging system for scalar variables is missing. For existing objects like ScalarLagrangeMultiplier, the assembly is handled in a non-standard way.\nSo it seems like now is a great time to develop some standards for computing and assembling the scalar contributions, while allowing a developer to still derive off of higher base classes and avoid these standards if their problem doesn't fit the usual mold.\nSince each of the IntegratedBC, (Mortar)Constraint, InterfaceKernel, and DGKernel are in need of such Jacobian and assembly implementations, I'm volunteering to tackle them in that order, since I can formulate diffusion equation analogs for the first 3 of the 4.\nTo finalize the objectives of the developments, I don't know if that discussion should happen within an issue or through this forum discussion. So I'll just post 4 thoughts to start a dialog to finalize on the interface used for treating these scalar variables with other variables:\n\nI've also noticed objects besides Kernel and DGKernel are missing pre-calculate method calls to allow the override of the ResidualObject method prior to the quadrature loop. Technically most classes can override the lower level quadrature and add it back, but the mortar constraint does a 'final' override which prevents this (why?). So I'll add those along the way.\nI need help understanding how the assembly sequence works (prepare, tagging, adding, caching, accumulating)\nI propose that the off-diagonal Jacobian scalar methods always provide two quadrature loops which call methods with a name like \"computeQpOffDiagJacobianVariableScalar\" and \"computeQpOffDiagJacobianScalarVariable\" to handle both of the directions of the coupling (regular variable to scalar variable and scalar variable to regular variable). Generally, these two couplings are not equal (equal for ScalarLagrangeMultiplier, not for HomogenizedTotalLagrangianStressDivergence). Handling these contributions in each regular variable object class (Kernel, \u2026) avoids having to make a bunch of different loops within sub-classes of ScalarKernel.\nLet user objects handle the integral of the residual and on-diagonal Jacobian contributions of the scalar variable, as in HomogenizationConstraintIntegral. Providing template user objects for each regular variable object class along with one scalar kernel that references the residual/Jacobian would seem like a \"friendly\" system for new developers to contribute to\n\nThoughts???",

I was wondering if this capability could also be available in coupled calculations with Multiapps when the main app and subapp use different meshes and the subapp mesh need to be split.  For example, in a coupled neutronics+ thermal simulation, the main app Griffin uses a coarse nodal mesh and calls subapp Bison which has a large refined mesh. The --use-split option when running this case would try to look for a split Griffin mesh but not for Bison.\nThanks",

If you're still using 'conda' I suppose you'll want to keep doing what you're doing. But my advice is to install mamba (conda install mamba), and then use that. Mamba works exactly like conda. The only thing mamba can't do, are the config subcommands (conda config --add channel etc).\nWe have updated our instructions to be a bit more clean moving forward:\nmamba create -n moose moose-libmesh moose-tools\nmamba activate moose\nWith that all out of the way, I take it the issue persists?
