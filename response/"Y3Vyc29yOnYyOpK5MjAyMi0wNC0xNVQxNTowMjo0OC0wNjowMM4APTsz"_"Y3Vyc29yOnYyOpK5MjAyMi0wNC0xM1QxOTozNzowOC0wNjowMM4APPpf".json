When I do this in a transient simulation, it seems I'm getting the full history in each csv file up to the current time. The current MaterialVectorPostprocessor test is a steady state test, so this behavior isn't seen. But if I modify the input file to do a Transient simulation like this:\n# test that all scalar material properties are properly recorded in basic usage.\n[Mesh]\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n  dim = 2\n  nx = 10\n  ny = 10\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [./u]\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [./diff]\n    type = Diffusion\n    variable = u\n  [../]\n  [./time]\n    type = TimeDerivative\n    variable = u\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [./left]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = u\n    boundary = left\n    value = 0\n  [../]\n  [./right]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = u\n    boundary = right\n    value = 1\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [./mat]\n    type = GenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'prop1 prop2 prop3'\n    prop_values = '1 2 42'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[VectorPostprocessors]\n  [./vpp]\n    type = MaterialVectorPostprocessor\n    material = 'mat'\n    elem_ids = '3 4 7 42 88'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  dt = 1\n  num_steps = 3\n  solve_type = PJFNK\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_hypre_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'hypre boomeramg'\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  execute_on = 'initial timestep_end'\n  csv = true\n[]\n\nthen each CSV file is longer than the previous and presumably contains data from previous timesteps.

I checked some functions in the base class that has been overwritten in the child class and printed out some key variables. All look good. The problem is that all outputted strain_zz are 0 under a certain temperature and pressure in BCs. But if I used tensile load like '0.01*t', there will output non-zero values. This is very strange. I hope the simulation is performed using the former conditions. Could anyone share ideas and advice with me to fix it?",

As a result, no dislocation evolution occurred in the simulation.\n\nThe simulation results from these input file changes do show the evolution of the total lagrangian strain (beyond the initial elastic response you showed above) and plastic deformation gradient. For quick reference, here are the two input files I used to investigate this issue:\n\nModified input file: userlist_hcp_corrected.txt\nOriginal input file, with additional outputs for the dislocation densities:\nuserlist_hcp_original_extra_outputs.txt\n\nI'll add figures to compare the results early next week. I hope the comparison input files will help in debugging your custom creep behavior class",

Developers can place an HDF5 installation in the following searched locations:\n/usr/lib/hdf5\n/usr/local/hdf5\n/usr/share/hdf5\n/usr/local/hdf5/share\n$HOME/.local\nOr select a custom location by setting one of the environment variables HDF5_DIR, HDF5DIR, or HDF5_ROOT. If a compatible installation cannot be found, PETSc will download and build it for the user on Linux. This fallback download option is not yet available on MacOS, but will be coming soon. Subsequently, the update_and_rebuild_libmesh script now uses the --enable-hdf5 configure flag and, with recent libMesh changes, attempts to find the HDF5 installation used by PETSc.\nThe new conda packages mentioned above all contain the PETSc default HDF5 on Linux, but no HDF5 is currently provided on MacOS (coming soon). A serial, pre-built HDF5 is available within the moose-tools package on either platform if this is sufficient for developer needs.",

Furthermore, in looking at the AbaqusUMATStress source, it appears to be requesting a strain_increment material, among others, which are not available in the ComputeSmallStrain class.\nSo it appears the AbaqusUMATStress functionality is (currently) not compatible with a small strain approximation. Is this an Abaqus limitation? Or could AbaqusUMATStress be modified to also handle small strains?",

Currently the AbaqusUMATStress material requires the material properties provided by our finite strain formulation to be present, even if the UMAT implements a small strain formulation. We can certainly fix that by adding a flag that makes the finite strain increments optional.\nEither way, it should not be necessary to have a custom UMAT with \"changes to make it compatible with MOOSE\".",
