For example, the line 114-120 in ADComputeFiniteStrain.C are:\n// Update strain in intermediate configuration\n  _mechanical_strain[_qp] = _mechanical_strain_old[_qp] + _strain_increment[_qp];\n  _total_strain[_qp] = _total_strain_old[_qp] + total_strain_increment;\n\n  // Rotate strain to current configuration\n  _mechanical_strain[_qp].rotate(_rotation_increment[_qp]);\n  _total_strain[_qp].rotate(_rotation_increment[_qp]);\n\nWhat do the \"intermediate configuration\" and the \"current configuration\" mean? Why should the mechanical and total strain be \"rotated\" but the strain increment don't need to? Does any one know this? Thanks.\nBest Regards,\nXiaobei",

In this example, the inflation of the magma cavity (the ellipse), induce stress concentration in the host-rock at the tip of the ellipse. In nature, the host-rock would break where stress concentration occurs, creating space for the magma to propagate.\n\nyeah, this is definitely doable using the existing infrastructure, it just requires you to do development (knowing some c++ and willing to write code)\n\nI will try to look at code development and assess if it is doable for me :)\nBest regards,\nR\u00e9mi",
