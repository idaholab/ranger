          "bodyText": "Is there a way within a MOOSE app to do some memory estimation ahead of the simulation? In ansys runs it will calculate the memory needed for a solve to fit entirely in memory or if it needs to switch to writing to disk for the simulation.\nWhat I have run into is simulations that will start in a configuration on the HPC and exit with code 9, which I believe is an out of memory error. Sometimes when I adjust the configuration to use less cpus per node and more nodes to get more memory the solve will run. Other times it will still not solve and still exit with an error code 9.\nIt would be nice if I could get an estimate during the MOOSE setup where it determines how much memory it thinks it will need so that I can determine if the solve was never going to work or if there was potentially a memory leak somewhere.",

You can get a view of the current memory expenditure from the perf graph live print.\nCode 9 is indeed OOM.\nReducing the number of processes, using distributed meshes, removing auxiliary fields that are not needed are all good ways to reduce the memory footprint rapidly. For further improvements, you'll want to work on the preconditioning cost most of the time.\n\nor if there was potentially a memory leak somewhere.\n\nif you have a cluster with valgrind installed, it should be fairly easy to detect most memory leaks with that.\nWe should write this down as a feature request. I think we can get a ball park estimate fairly easily, but it wont be very accurate without a lot of work interfacing with petsc to predict its needs\nGuillaume",

          "bodyText": "Dear moose experts,\nI am writing to address an issue with numerical inconsistency during the transfer of an AuxVariable named df_elastic_dgr0 from a sub-cp case to a main-pf case within our multi-app case.\nSpecifically, I have initiated a multi-app scenario, comprising 02_parent_pf.i and 02_sub_cp.i. The objective is to facilitate the transfer of the MaterialProperty df_elastic/dgr0 from the sub-cp simulation to the main-pf simulation. To execute this, I initially utilized the auxkernel MaterialRealAux within the sub-cp simulation to generate the auxVariable df_elastic_dgr0. Subsequently, employing the MultiAppCopyTransfer, I transferred df_elastic_dgr0 to the main-pf simulation. Despite sharing the identical name, df_elastic_dgr0, it has come to my attention that there exists a discrepancy between the values of df_elastic_dgr0 observed in the sub-cp and main-pf simulations, as illustrated in the attached figure.\n\nThis discrepancy is concerning and may indicate an issue either in the configuration of the MultiAppCopyTransfer or in the handling of the AuxVariable within the simulations. I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or examples you can provide to help me address this challenge effectively. Your expertise in this matter is invaluable, and your guidance will significantly impact the success of my project.\nThank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to your response and guidance.\nBest regards,\nWei",
