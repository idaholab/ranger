E.g. start with a FunctionDT for exactly defined time steps, and then allow an IterationAdaptive timestepper to take over at a defined point.\nstart_time and end_time in the Transient Executioner block apply to all settings, not just the timestepper.\nCan this be done using TimePeriod controls?  If so, how are these cross-referenced between the Executioner and Controls blocks?\nOr can sub-blocks with appropriate start and end times be specified within the main Executioners block (similar to defining sub-blocks for a stitched mesh)?\nI can't seem to find any specific examples of the syntax showing how to do these if they are possible.\nAlternatively, do the parameters \"time_t\" and \"time_dt\" allow some specific timestep values to be set within an IterationAdaptiveDT timestepper?  Is there an example of this syntax?\nThese two previous questions and answers seem to have related information, but are for more specific cases reacting to values obtained during a solve:\n#23344\n#23414\nI'm trying to set up some defined times at the start of a solve, so this should be much simpler (I think).",

I expected the \"time_dt\" values to be default time step values which are applied after each corresponding \"time_t\" value.  But this isn't what happened.\nIt might easier to explain what I'd like to happen.\nInitially, up to t = 600, I'd like the equivalent of this FunctionDT:\n\ntype = FunctionDT\nfunction = 'if(t<60, 6, 30)'\n\nThen after this, from t = 600:\n\ntype = IterationAdaptiveDT\ndt = 24\ncutback_factor = 0.5\ngrowth_factor = 2\n\n\nSo the timestep could be cut back to 12, 6 (or smaller), but if possible it will grow, maybe applying a maximum value of 192 (or larger depending on circumstances).\nI tried to do a version of this using:\n\n[TimeStepper]\ntype = IterationAdaptiveDT\ndt = 6\ncutback_factor = 0.5\ngrowth_factor = 2\ntime_t = '0 60 600 624'\ntime_dt = '6 30 6 24'\n[]\n\nAnd I got this set of time values up to 600.

I have a boundary that varies as a function of pressure and time; however, the variation cannot be defined with an analytical expression and must be interpolated. Using a function BC that pulls a value from a PiecewiseBilinear function seems like the right approach, but I don't think there is a way to interpolate within PiecewiseBilinear with quantities other than space and time as it is currently written. Is there a way to accomplish this without writing a custom kernel?",

When you use multiply_by_density = false, the flux_function of PorousFlowSink is measured in m^3.m^-2.s^-1.\nPlease think carefully about whether you want to use multiply_by_density = false.  Eg, quoting from PorousFlowFullySaturated:\n\"When not multiply by density, in many situations the sum of Eq. (1) will imply a Laplace equation such 0=\u2207(k(\u2207P\u2212\u03c1g)), that is a steady-state distribution for the porepressure.
