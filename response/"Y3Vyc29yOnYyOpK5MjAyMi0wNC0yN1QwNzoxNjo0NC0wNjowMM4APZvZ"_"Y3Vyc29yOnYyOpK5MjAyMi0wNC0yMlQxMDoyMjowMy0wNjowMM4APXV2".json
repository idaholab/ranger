Not sure if by design or just an oversight.\nIn poking around in the code for the generalized plane strain problem, it looks like the GeneralizedPlaneStrainUserObject requires an entry from the elasticity tensor to compute the Jacobian contribution for the out-of-plane scalar variable (see here). But the problem is that when using AbaqusUMATStress, a global elasticity tensor material does not always need to be built, and as such, MOOSE cannot access specific components of the tensor. The AbaqusUMATStress material does access the components of the tensor in UMAT-notation in order to contribute to the Jacobian for the displacement variables (I believe, here), but that information does not make it over to the GeneralizedPlaneStrainUserObject.\nSo it seems like the information that it needs to do generalized plane strain is available from the UMAT interface, I'm just not sure if there's an \"easy\" way to get at it from the GeneralizedPlaneStrainUserObject.",

Does it make sense for GeneralizedPlaneStrainUserObject to also use this property? Right now it uses the elasticity tensor but there are a number of occasions (here and here) where the Jacobian_mult property is set equal to the elasticity tensor.\nGuess I'm just looking for the easy way out. Besides, the GeneralizedPlaneStrainUserObject only needs a single entry from the elasticity tensor to compute the Jacobian. Seems a bit overkill to create a new class just to get at a single value. I could be way off base here, so please let me know if I'm misunderstanding things.",
