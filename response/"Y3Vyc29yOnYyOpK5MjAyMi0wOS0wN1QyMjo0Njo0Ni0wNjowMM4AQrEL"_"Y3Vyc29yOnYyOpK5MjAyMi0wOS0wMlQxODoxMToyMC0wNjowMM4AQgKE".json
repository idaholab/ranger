          "bodyText": "Hi MOOSE team,\nI'm doing some comparisons between the MOOSE thermal hydraulics module and other methods of solving for outlet temperatures in a counter-current heat exchanger. I have done some comparisons to the NTU method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTU_method) (https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/hydro/ref/entuheattransfer.html) and some CFD calculations I have done in ANSYS FLUENT. Below I have attached a picture of the cross-section of the heat exchanger I have modelled. The inner channel is referred to as ch1/fch in my input file and carries an ideal gas with an inlet temp of 300 K. There is a 5cm thick wall between this channel and the outer channel, referred to as ch2/fch_outer in my input file which carries another ideal gas with an inlet temperature of 500 K. The ideal gas values are sort of arbitrary but are made sure to be consistent with the values used in fluent.\n\nBelow I have plotted the outlet temperature of the inner channel (ch1/fch). My MOOSE results vary with time as it is a transient solve, but my fluent and NTU method results are steady state hence the straight line. I am seeing a very large differential in my results which I can't explain and was wondering if anyone could spot anything wrong with my input file. As the fluent solve is done on a 3D mesh, the plotted result is the average outlet temperature of the inner channel. Do you know if the FlowChannel1Phase is supposed to approximate the average temperature of the channel as well, or would it just capture the maximum temperature?\n\nI have attached my input file below, sorry as there is a lot of faff in it where I am using lots of postprocessors and functions to calculate my NTU results, but they can be ignored for the most part. Any help is greatly appreciated as I am really lost on this one!\nT_in = 300         # K\nm_dot_in = 10\npress = 1e5         # Pa\n\n# core parameters\nwall_thickness = ${units 5. cm -> m}\nfch_length = 10   # m\nfch_n_elems = 100\nfch_dia = 0.5\nfch_radius_wall = ${fparse fch_dia/2 + wall_thickness}\nconvective_HTC = 2000\n\n#counter flow params\nfch_outer_dia = 1.0\n\n\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  initial_p = ${press}\n  initial_vel = 0\n  initial_T = ${T_in}\n  gravity_vector = '0 0 0'\n  rdg_slope_reconstruction = full\n  closures = simple_closures\n[]\n\n[HeatStructureMaterials]\n  [steel]\n    type = SolidMaterialProperties\n    rho = 8050\n    k = 45\n    cp = 466\n  []\n[]\n\n[Modules/FluidProperties]\n  [fluid_cold]\n    type = IdealGasFluidProperties\n    molar_mass = 2.897e-2\n    gamma = 1.4\n    k = 0.025\n    mu = 3e-5\n  []\n\n  [fluid_hot]\n    type = IdealGasFluidProperties\n    molar_mass = 4e-3\n    gamma = 1.67\n    k = 0.156\n    mu = 3e-5\n  []\n[]\n\n[Closures]\n  [simple_closures]\n    type = Closures1PhaseSimple\n  []\n[]\n\n[Components]\n\n    [ch1]\n        [inlet]\n            type = InletMassFlowRateTemperature1Phase\n            input = 'ch1/fch:in'\n            m_dot = ${m_dot_in}\n            T = ${T_in}\n        []\n\n        #Flow channel setup\n        [fch]\n            type = FlowChannel1Phase\n            position = '0 0 0'\n            orientation = '1 0 0'\n            length = ${fch_length}\n            n_elems = ${fch_n_elems}\n            A = ${fparse pi * fch_dia * fch_dia / 4.}\n            D_h = ${fparse fch_dia}\n            fp = fluid_cold\n            f = 1.6\n        []\n\n        [outlet]\n            type = Outlet1Phase\n            input = 'ch1/fch:out'\n            p = ${press}\n        []\n    []\n\n\n    [ch2]\n        [inlet]\n            type = InletMassFlowRateTemperature1Phase\n            input = 'ch2/fch_outer:out'\n            m_dot = -${m_dot_in}\n            T = 500\n        []\n\n        #Flow channel setup\n        [fch_outer]\n            type = FlowChannel1Phase\n            position = '0 0 0'\n            orientation = '1 0 0'\n            length = ${fch_length}\n            n_elems = ${fch_n_elems}\n            A = ${fparse pi * ((fch_outer_dia * fch_outer_dia/4) -

                  "bodyText": "The ideal gas values are sort of arbitrary but are made sure to be consistent with the values used in fluent.\n\nI'm not sure about the \"arbitrary\" part. I believe gamma and molar_mass are very relevant for this problem, since they determine the relation between internal energy and temperature. It sounds like you've made them consistent with your other runs, but I just want to make sure.\n\nDo you know if the FlowChannel1Phase is supposed to approximate the average temperature of the channel as well, or would it just capture the maximum temperature?\n\nIt approximates the average. More accurately, it approximates the average of the total energy density (and density and momentum density) and then computes temperature at those values.\nThis may be difficult: I don't see anything obviously wrong with your input, and your results are at least following physical trends. We just don't know why it's skewed toward the other end of the temperature range. This is mostly just a question of heat transfer, rather than flow. The key things I can think to look at are:\n\nheat transfer conditions of THM vs. your other codes (make sure they are all doing the same thing: htc*(T - T_wall))\nEOS of the working fluid (gamma and molar_mass)\ncross-sectional area of each channel\nheated perimeter of each channel P_hf\n\nNumber 1 is the most important. I already mentioned 2. 3 and 4 look correct.",

What is this SymmetryBC that you are referring to? The only symmetry BC I'm aware of is the INSFVSymmetryBC which wouldn't be appropriate for the finite element model you're using here. For boundary conditions on the outer \"walls\" I might try a zero velocity boundary condition for the normal velocity and a natural condition (e.g. no boundary condition) for the tangential velocity components. Moreover, I would also use a natural boundary condition on the outlet as opposed to a dirichlet value for pressure.\nA lot of the models you are sharing on Discussions are pretty complex. Have you tried two dimensional versions of these models? Have you tried models starting with just the fluid flow domain and omitting the conjugate heat transfer physics? I always like to walk before I run, so if you haven't tried simplified versions of the models yet (you may very well have), I would highly encourage doing so.",

And I tried a new simpler 2D fluid model which removes the heat transfer part and just has the continuity and momentum equations. I think problems reflected in simple models may become ideas for solving complex models. This is a steady problem and BCs are given:\n\nThe solved pressure field is a little strange. And I plot a line for pressure in the y direction.\n\nWhy does this oscillation appear at the bottom of the pressure field? I have added PSPG item and SUPG item in input file.\nActually I had this problem a long time ago, but after I integrated the fluid part with the solid part and used PeriodicBC on the outer boundary of the fluid region, the problem disappeared. Now when I want to replace PeriodicBC with SymmetryBC (no BC) , it comes up again. Thanks for your suggestion @lindsayad , I will try simple models first, then complex ones!\nHere are input and output files.\nfiles.zip",

I just learned today that for the momentum equation, the SymmetricBC and Slip boundary condition are the same, they both have 0 normal velocity. I thought symmetric boundary conditions were natural boundary conditions before, but obviously I was wrong. Based on the settings of the boundary conditions in your input file, I combined @lindsayad 's advice on ADVectorFunctionDirichletBC to get a new set of boundary conditions:\n[BCs]\n  [./no_slip]\n    type = VectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'left'\n  [../]\n  [./inlet_velocity]\n    type = VectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'bottom'\n    function_y = ${inlet_velocity}\n  [../]\n  [./symmetry]\n    type = ADVectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'right'\n    function_x = 0\n    set_x_comp = true\n    set_y_comp = false\n    set_z_comp = false\n  [../]\n  [./outlet_p]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = p\n    boundary = 'top'\n    value = ${outlet_pressure}\n  [../]\n[]\n\nThe meaning of the [Symmetry] block is to set the normal component of the velocity on the right boundary to 0, and the tangential component defaults to a natural boundary condition. Combining other parts of the original input file, I get the following velocity distribution and pressure distribution. Do you think this result is reasonable?\n\nHere are complete input and output files:\ncomplete_files.zip",

The reason for the so-called \"convergence with PeriodicBC , but not with SymmetryBC \" I encountered before is that the SymmetryBC is set wrong. There is no SymmetryBC in the finite element INS module of MOOSE, so SymmetryBC needs to be obtained by setting DirichletBC and NeumannBC to the velocity variable.\nI used to think that SymmetryBC was equal to the natural boundary condition, which is not the case. SymmetryBC should look like this:\n\nThe normal component of velocity is 0 and the gradient of the tangential component of velocity is 0. The VectorFunctionDirichletBC currently does not support setting a specific component, which means that if you want to use VectorFunctionDirichletBC, you need to set a function for the velocity x_comp, y_comp, z_comp respectively (the components default to 0 if not supplied). But what we want is to set x_comp to 0 and the gradient of y_comp to 0. So we can use ADVectorFunctionDirichletBC, by setting set_y_comp=false to avoid giving DirichletBC to y_comp, which means the y component of velocity has a NeumannBC with a value of 0. The input file is as follows:\n  [./symmetry]\n    type = ADVectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'fluid_wall'\n    function_x = 0\n    set_x_comp = true\n    set_y_comp = false\n    set_z_comp = false\n  [../]\n\nI have calculated a 2D fluid flow problem with PeriodicBC and SummetryBC respectively (please ignore the heat transfer part of it) and they have exactly the same velocity field distribution.\nHere are complete input and output files.

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI want to know how to impose weak spring boundary condition like in ANSYS when using MOOSE. My simulated object swells and I want to have the thermal expansion be almost free on most surfaces. I am trying not to assume how it should swell by fixing the rigid body motion by DirichletBC. I am currently considering Robin BC so that traction will be proportional to the displacement. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}=ku$. k will be a small negative number. But simulation did not converged with CoupledVarNeumannBC.\n\nIs Robin BC the right BC to impose weak spring BC in MOOSE? If not, does MOOSE have one?\nIs CoupledVarNeumannBC the right MOOSE object to use for Robin BC for displacement field? If not, does MOOSE have one?\nDoes MOOSE have a warning option for rigid body motion? Sometimes for simple problems, the simulation converged to a reasonable result even the displacement constraints did not forbid rigid body motion.",

So yes, the CoupledVarNeumannBC should work, you may need to repeat it three times for the three components though (twice in 2D, obviously).\n3 is a tricky one. You can test for null space by looking at the singular values of your matrix. To do that, first reduce the size of your problem, then run it with -pc_type svd. If the minimum singular value is near zero then you definitely have a null space. Whether that null space corresponds to a rigid body mode is at your discretion.",

          "bodyText": "Hi, moose experts.\nI want to solve fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer problem which has a cylindrical inner heat sorce and square fluid channel. The model is like this:\n\nConsidering that the solid will expand radially and axially when heated, and the expansion of the solid will affect the temperature field and flow field. So I write a thermo-mechanical coupling input file to simulate the effect of elevated temperature on solid deformation. The model of thermo-mechanical coupling input file is like this:\n\nThe dimensions of the solid cylinders in both models are identical, and their meshing is identical. Now, I want to incorporate thermo-mechanical coupling into the original fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer. There are many problems that follow, such as the grid displacement of the solid area will also affect the grid of the fluid area. In addition, after the solid is elongated in the axial direction, the fluid cannot wrap the solid. How can I fix this problem? I mean how to solve thermomechanical coupling and fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer simultaneously in one input file.\nThe first one is fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer input file:\n# Units: specific_heat_capacity--cp--J/(kg.K); density--rho--kg/(cm^3);\n# dynamic_viscosity--mu--kg/(cm.s); thermal_conductivity--k--W/(cm.K);\n# pressure--kg/(cm.s^2); force--kg.cm/s^2\n\noutlet_pressure = 0\ninlet_velocity = 150 # cm/s\nini_temp = 300 # K\nheat_transfer_coefficient = 9 # W/(cm2.K)\ng = -981 # cm/s2\nalpha_fluid = 2e-4 # thermal expansion coefficient of fluid used in INSADBoussinesqBodyForce\n\n[Mesh]\n  file = 'solid_fluid.msh'\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [./T]\n    initial_condition = ${ini_temp}\n  [../]\n  [./velocity]\n    family = LAGRANGE_VEC\n    block = 'fluid'\n  [../]\n  [./p]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    block = 'fluid'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[AuxVariables]\n  [./heat]\n    family = MONOMIAL\n    order = FIRST\n    block = 'solid'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [./initial_velocity]\n    type = VectorConstantIC\n    x_value = 0\n    y_value = 0\n    z_value = ${inlet_velocity}\n    variable = velocity\n  [../]\n  [./initial_p]\n    type = FunctionIC\n    variable = p\n    function = ini_p\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [./fluid_mass]\n    type = INSADMass\n    variable = p\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_mass_pspg]\n    type = INSADMassPSPG\n    variable = p\n  [../]\n\n  [./fluid_momentum_time]\n    type = INSADMomentumTimeDerivative\n    variable = velocity\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_convection]\n    type = INSADMomentumAdvection\n    variable = velocity\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_viscous]\n    type = INSADMomentumViscous\n    variable = velocity\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_pressure]\n    type = INSADMomentumPressure\n    variable = velocity\n    pressure = p\n    integrate_p_by_parts = true\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_gravity]\n    type = INSADGravityForce\n    variable = velocity\n    gravity = '0 0 ${g}'\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_buoyancy]\n    type = INSADBoussinesqBodyForce\n    variable = velocity\n    gravity = '0 0 ${g}'\n    alpha_name = 'alpha_fluid'\n    ref_temp = 'T_ref'\n\ttemperature = T\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_momentum_supg]\n    type = INSADMomentumSUPG\n    variable = velocity\n    velocity = velocity\n  [../]\n\n  [./fluid_temperature_time]\n    type = INSADHeatConductionTimeDerivative\n    variable = T\n    block = 'fluid'\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_temperature_conduction]\n    type = ADHeatConduction\n    variable = T\n    block = 'fluid'\n    thermal_conductivity = 'k'\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_temperature_advection]\n    type = INSADEnergyAdvection\n    variable = T\n    block = 'fluid'\n  [../]\n  [./fluid_temperature_supg]\n    type = INSADEnergySUPG\n    variable = T\n    velocity = velocity\n    block = 'fluid'\n  [../]\n\n  [./solid_temperature_time]\n    type = ADHeatConductionTimeDerivative\n    variable = T\n    block = 'solid'\n    density_name = 'rho'\n    specific_heat = 'cp'\n  [../]\n  [./solid_temperature_conduction]\n    type = ADHeatConduction\n    variable = T\n    block = 'solid'\n    thermal_conductivity = 'k'\n  [../]\n  [./heat_source]\n    type = ADCoupledForce\n    variable = T\n    block = 'solid'\n    v = heat\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[AuxKernels]\n  [./heat_aux]\n    type = FunctionAux\n    variable = heat\n    function = heat_function\n    block = 'solid'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[InterfaceKernels]\n  [./convection_heat_transfer]\n    type = ConjugateHeatTransfer\n    variable = T\n    T_fluid = T\n    neighbor_var = 'T'\n    boundary = 'solid_wall'\n    htc = 'htc'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [./inlet_T_fluid]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = T\n    boundary = 'fluid_bottom'\n    value = ${ini_temp}\n  [../]\n  [./inlet_velocity_fluid]\n    type = VectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'fluid_bottom'\n    function_z = ${inlet_velocity}\n  [../]\n  [./outlet_p_fluid]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = p\n    boundary = 'fluid_top'\n    value = ${outlet_pressure}\n  [../]\n\n  [./no_slip]\n    type = VectorFunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = velocity\n    boundary = 'solid_wall'\n  [../]\n\n  [./Periodic]\n    [./x]\n      variable = velocity\n      primary = 'fluid_wall1'\n      secondary = 'fluid_wall2'\n      translation = '1.6 0 0'\n    [../]\n    [./y]\n      variable = velocity\n      primary = 'fluid_wall3'\n      secondary = 'fluid_wall4'\n      translation = '0 1.6 0'\n    [../]\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [./rho_solid]\n    type = ADParsedMaterial\n    f_name = rho\n    function = '0.0110876 * pow(9.9672e-1 + 1.179e-5 * T -

If the solid part is not elongated in the axial direction, it will expand in the radial direction and bend (when the model is slender). In this case the deformation of the solid region will have an effect on the fluid mesh, should I add an InterfaceKernel for fluid-structure interaction at the fluid and solid interface? If so, what InterfaceKernel does you guys recommend?\nI found that different objects have different default values for the use_displaced_mesh parameter. For example, use_displaced_mesh = true in ADHeatConductionTimeDerivative, but use_displaced_mesh = false in INSADEnergyAdvvection and DirichletBC. Do I have to set use_displaced_mesh = true in all objects if I want to model thermal-mechanic coupling in detail and adequately? Or just stick to their default values?",

                  "bodyText": "Hello\nIf you did not want to apply zero axial displacement at the top and bottom boundaries, you should consider applying them at least at the bottom, and simulate a larger fluid domain. If the solid is \"exiting\" the simulation domain by expanding, it means your simulation domain is too small and should include what's on top of the solid.\nSingle input file approach could work. You may want to consider a small case first, like a plate inside a square fluid, to see if you can get decent numerical convergence. Alternatively, you may use the MultiApps system to segregate the (fluid + solid thermal) and the solid mechanical solve.\nGuillaume",
