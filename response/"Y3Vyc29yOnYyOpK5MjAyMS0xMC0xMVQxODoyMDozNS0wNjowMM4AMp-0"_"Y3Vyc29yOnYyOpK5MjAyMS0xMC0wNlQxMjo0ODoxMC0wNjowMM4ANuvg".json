It can be done with some hacking (reinit on neighbor element, compute, reinit on local)\nYou can access the neighbor material properties in interface_kernels though. If you are using those and the work performed in the material computeProperties() can be moved there, that is an option.\nCould you please give us more details about your use case?\nSecond caveat:\nIt can be done in the functor material system which we are adding here, and which does not leverage computeProperties but does on-demand computation of matprops : #18395\nGuillaume",

In the first case I use the following kernels (TimeDerivative, CahnHilliard, CHInterface) and in the second one I defined a chemical potential for each grain and I use (CoupleTimeDerivative, SplitCHParsed, SplitCHWRes). Results are not the same and I do not understand this because formulations should be equivalent.
