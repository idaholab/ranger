I've tried to apply this function by using a NodalKernal but it appears that the value I've set gets added for as many elements are associated with any given node. Are there any examples of adding values directly to the residual at a given node without this duplication?\nThanks,\nNathan",

When I use a NodalKernel in the 3 (Z) direction and also define a preset DirichletBC to be zero on some of the faces (to define a uniaxial stress problem) the residuals reported on the X and Y faces don't go to zero even though the problem converges and the non-DirichletBC faces do go to zero as expected.

For the record, I updated libmesh and MOOSE this morning and I'm running on master. I did notice that the duplicate problem seems to be gone (thanks for that) but I still notice the error in residual calculation for the nodes which have a preset DirichletBC when a forcing function is being applied to the residual.\nI'm using a uniaxial stress example only so that I can be sure of what the answer should be. I don't think this is a problem with tensor mechanics since I have observed this behavior with my own kernels in similar situations. The errors can be observed for any node on the x, y, or z=0 face. I expect to see the value of zero for the applied force (AppliedForce) in the x and y directions (FInternal_1 and FInternal_2) on every node and equal to the negative force in the z direction (FInternal_3) but this is not the case for the BC nodes. It seems like the residual is not updating for nodes on the boundaries?\nMinimumExample.zip",

I can successfully ssh to hpclogin.inl.gov, but the remote access instructions on the MOOSE website don't work for me - I cannot get to hpclogin.hpc.inl.gov through Firefox 83.0. I also tried Safari 14.0 and had no luck.\nThe strange thing is that I have this proxy set up just fine on another computer (macOS 10.14.6), and I'm just straight copying what I did in Firefox's network settings to my new computer. I tried adding no proxy for google.com, and I can get through to it just fine - so it seems that something about hpclogin.hpc.inl.gov doesn't work for me.\nThis may be an issue with Firefox or Mac, but I just wanted to ask the question here in case any other Mac users have this problem? Am I missing a factor of hpc somewhere (I vaguely remember something in the past having to do with different website URLs for external vs. internal users)? Is there some permissions I need to change in macOS 10.15.7 that I didn't need before?\nThanks,\n-April",

It looks like the rotation matrix being built in https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/modules/tensor_mechanics/src/utils/RotationTensor.C is the transpose of what you would expect based on the vector indices being stored, assuming you enter in the values row-wise (index 0 is R11, index 1 is R12, etc). Depending on the application, the transpose may be what you want, but I just want to be clear what's going on. The Euler angles for a rotation matrix and its transpose will be different.",

As the documentation clearly stated, the Bunge convention is used for the Euler angles, meaning the angles are used to build the passive (sample-to-crystal) rotation matrix, so yes, the transpose of the matrix is computed and applied when using Euler angles.\nThe documentation has been updated a bit. See also #16341. I added some functionality such that one can apply a rotation matrix directly to the elasticity tensor.",

The input file works correctly using parameters from Koyama 2004. When switching my parameters to those in Lv. 2010, I'm running into convergence issues where my data doesn't go past 1 second. I changed my temperature to a global parameter and now I'm looking into my executioner block to see if that's where my issue is.\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\nFeCrCo.zip\nKoyama_2004.pdf\nLv_2010_PF of FeCrCo.pdf",

Historically the guidance has always been that the solvers will work best when units are chosen such that all parameters are of order unity. That is why I mentioned making sure the units are the same between the parameters in the two papers.\n-A recently added option is automatic variable scaling, which will apply a scaling factor to each residual equation to try to make sure that the contribute approximately the same to the residual. This option can be turned on by setting the parameter automatic_scaling = true in the Executioner block.",
