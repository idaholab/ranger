You can remove all subdomains but one with a ParsedSubdomainGenerator at the end of the mesh generator step and only leave one.\nYou can do the same with a CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier and a well chosen threshold.\nBut are you trying to remove the blocks from the mesh or not? An element can only have one block.\nIf you need more flexibility than that, you'll want to work with extra element integer IDs.\nThere are less objects for those (than using subdomains/blocks), but the objects missing are easy enough to re-create",

If so, correcting it might be important for ensuring the accuracy of the energy calculations in the phase field fracture models.\nAppreciate for your time and patience.\nSincerely",

          "bodyText": "Hello, this issue is related to ticket #23280. It turns out that the optimal EOS for my simulation should have salt precipitation and dissolution and should also account for porosity and permeability variation. TOUGH2\u2019s EWASG (Battistelli,1997), instead of EOS4, seems the most appropriate. I, however, struggle to get the EWASG equivalent in PF. The closest I could get are PorousFlowWaterNCG  and PorousFlowBrineCO2. The latter seems more suitable, so I tried simulating TOUGH2\u2019s EWASG example with it, but my simulation did not converge. It is probably because the PorousFlowBrineCO2 does not include the effect of dissolution and precipitation of halite. Could you please recommend a PF fluid state module that can do this? Or do I need to make any code modifications to PorousFlowBrineCO2? I attached my input file for the EWASG example that I tried.

As you might already know, I updated the ticket after thoroughly reviewing the documentation on PorousFlowBrineCO2 module. It turns out that PorousFlowBrineCO2 allows high temperatures up to 300\u2103 (just what I need) compared to TOUGH\u2019S ECO2N. Since CO2 occupies most of NCG (approx.. 90%) and PorousFlowBrineCO2 already has three components compared to PorousFlowWaterNCG, I already began updating the former to include the effect of halite dissolution and precipitation. I will consider switching to the latter.\nMy biggest challenge, according to section 2.1 of Blanco et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11242-018-1057-7 )  and section 3.2 of Battistelli et al. (https://www.rockware.com/downloads/documentation/petrasim/Battistelli_Stanford_2017.pdf), is to add an extra phase to represent the solid (halite) phase and accordingly implement the thermodynamic properties of this phase. What do you think?\nSo far, I\u2019m implementing the mass fraction of halite in the gas and aqueous phases based on correlations of Driesner and Heinrich (2007) and Palliser and McKibbin (1998). Please, let me know if I\u2019m on the right path. Thanks again!",

I tried to print out the output of the material property with MooseWarning, and it has some values inside the quadrature point. However, when I tried to use ElementAverageValue to determine whether the kernel got the material property, I found it is zero and does not change over time. So I wonder if I might make some mistakes in the kernel or material subroutine. Could you give me some advice? Thank you.\nHere is the material subroutine that I declared the material property:\n_edge_dislocation_increment(declareProperty<std::vector<Real>>(\"edge_dislocation_increment\")),\n    _edge_dislocation_increment_old(\n        getMaterialPropertyOld<std::vector<Real>>(\"edge_dislocation_increment\")),\n\n    _screw_dislocation_increment(declareProperty<std::vector<Real>>(\"screw_dislocation_increment\")),\n    _screw_dislocation_increment_old(\n        getMaterialPropertyOld<std::vector<Real>>(\"screw_dislocation_increment\"))\n\nAnd here is the code in kernel\n_edge_dislocation_increment(\n        getMaterialProperty<std::vector<Real>>(\"edge_dislocation_increment\")),\n    _screw_dislocation_increment(\n        getMaterialProperty<std::vector<Real>>(\"screw_dislocation_increment\")),\n\nAnd is there any test I could use to find out where leads to the problems?\nBest,\nZhangchen",

As my problem involves contact heat transfer so it needs coupling Solid Mechanics module to acquire contact pressure.\nDirectly I choose GapFluxModelPressureDependentConduction in my case like https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/dc8a1fb93b481f2d1f6ccb9e1367bd8547ac3650/modules/combined/test/tests/gap_heat_transfer_mortar/finite-2d/closed_gap_thermomechanical_mortar_contact.i.\nBut my problem is more complicated and I need to create multiapp to solve heat conduction and mechanics calculation respectively.\nI noticed there is contact pressure interface_normal_lm  which is a lowervalue so how can I transfer the value from mechanics card to heat conduction card?",
