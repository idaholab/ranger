          "bodyText": "Hey all,\nI am new to moose and trying to implement an ablating boundary condition.  I made some adjustments to the coupled convective heating boundary condition which is working well but I need to implement a receding boundary that is dependent on the convective heating solution.  Are there examples of a melting boundary condition I could look at?  It looks like people typically implement an elastic strain type BC to model this? Are there other options?  Any information/resources are appreciated.  Thanks.",

                  "bodyText": "Hi,\nSorry for the late reply. Your question is actually very timely -- we are right now developing new capabilities to model moving interfaces/boundaries. You'll soon be able to represent the moving interface by an element subdomain modifier and a geometric cut userobject (using levelset and XFEM). It is up to you how you want to update the levelset.\nWe can probably provide more help if you could let us know how your ablation boundary is receding, e.g. do you want to prescribe the movement of the boundary, or solve the movement so that it satisfies certain KKT condition on the interface?",

                          "bodyText": "Ah cool thanks for your help!\nThe movement of the boundary would be dependent on the heat transfer solution.  My plan for the heat transfer piece was to modify the convective heating boundary condition to include heat flux components that account for enthalpy required to change the phase of the solid material, and other fluxes.  Once a surface temperature solution is found that balances all the components, I would have a solution for the mass flux of ablating material at each qp.  Using a material density I could get a recession velocity for the surface, which I could prescribe to the boundary.  That is my preliminary plan to try, which might change as I learn more about all the pieces here. I have looked at the level set and XFEM modules a little bit, but don't have a lot of experience with them.",

          "bodyText": "I've been working on trying to leverage the HeliumFluidProperties class that is included within MOOSE within a custom class that I am creating. Initially, I tried including a copy of the HFP object as a reference in the protected section my new class: (i.e., HeliumFluidProperties & _hfp). While this was what I would prefer, I couldn't figure out how to correctly define the value within the class contructor. I was trying to do something like the following: _hfp(declareProperty<HeliumFluidProperties>(\"hfp\", parameters)), however this never worked...\nSo after looking at that for a while, I gave up on only constructing the object once and decided to just create an HFP object in a function right before I needed to use it. Based on the unit test included in MOOSE, I settled upon doing something like the following:\n  HeliumFluidProperties hfp = HeliumFluidProperties(\n    HeliumFluidProperties::validParams());\nWhile this code would finally compile, it did cause the MOOSE application to crash and burn during execution. Included below is a small section of the errors I ended up with as the code was crashing:\nERROR: no MooseApp* parameter named \"_moose_app\" found.\n\nKnown parameters:\nName\t Type\t Value\n---------------------\n T_initial_guess\t double\t 400\n _aux_sys\t AuxiliarySystem*\t 0\n _eigen_problem\t EigenProblem*\t 0\n _executioner\t Transient*\t 0\n _fe_problem\t FEProblem*\t 0\n _fe_problem_base\t FEProblemBase*\t 0\n _material_data_type\t Moose::MaterialDataType\t 0\n _moose_base\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t FluidProperties\n _moose_warehouse_system_name\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t UserObject\n _nl_sys\t SystemBase*\t 0\n _object_name\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t \n _residual_object\t bool\t 0\n _subproblem\t SubProblem*\t 0\n _sys\t SystemBase*\t 0\n _tid\t unsigned int\t 0\n _type\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t \n _unique_name\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t \n allow_duplicate_execution_on_initial\t bool\t 0\n allow_imperfect_jacobians\t bool\t 0\n control_tags\t std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, std::allocator<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > > >\t \n enable\t bool\t 1\n execute_on\t ExecFlagEnum\t TIMESTEP_END\n force_postaux\t bool\t 0\n force_preaux\t bool\t 0\n force_preic\t bool\t 0\n fp_type\t std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >\t single-phase-fp\n p_initial_guess\t double\t 200000\n prop_getter_suffix\t MaterialPropertyName\t \n tolerance\t double\t 1e-08\n use_displaced_mesh\t bool\t 0\n\nStack frames: 35\n0: libMesh::print_trace(std::ostream&)\n1: libMesh::MacroFunctions::report_error(char const*, int, char const*, char const*)\n2: /usr/share/moose/framework/libmoose-opt.so.0(+0x10f75b2) [0x7fdd4284e5b2]\n3: MooseApp* InputParameters::getCheckedPointerParam<MooseApp*>(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) const\n4: MooseObject::MooseObject(InputParameters const&)\n5: UserObject::UserObject(InputParameters const&)\n6: GeneralUserObject::GeneralUserObject(InputParameters const&)\n7: ThreadedGeneralUserObject::ThreadedGeneralUserObject(InputParameters const&)\n8: FluidProperties::FluidProperties(InputParameters const&)\n9: SinglePhaseFluidProperties::SinglePhaseFluidProperties(InputParameters const&)\n10: HeliumFluidProperties::HeliumFluidProperties(InputParameters const&)\n\nSo what I would really like to know is how I should go about initializing this fluid property within another custom class. Is it best to include it along with the other members of the class and initialize it at the same time, or would the second approach I took be more appropriate, or is the correct answer something else entirely.\nAnyhow, thanks in advance for any advice/help you guys provide me with!",

I want to start pumping fluid into this skeleton. I\nam using a porousflowsink to do this. What should be the boundary\nconditions on the end away from the pumping ? I want to model how long it\nwill take to fill this reservoir. So shpuld the initial condition be\nporepressure = -1e5 (patm) ?\n2) For the same situation, i would like to apply a mechanical stress on the\nend away from the pumping. So in effect the skeleton will exert a pressure\non the pump. In the thought experiment, the filling of the reservoir should\nnot be affected by this external mechanical stress, since the only thing\nthat governs the flow is the pressure gradient. Presumably the\ninitial condition here will be porepressure = -\\sigma will be the boundary\ncondition at the pumping site.\n\nNow the question on how to apply this initial condition.

Let me explain a little more about the problem.\nWe have a micro scale porous media attached to a permeabeable membrane,\nbelow which there is a comical chemical pump, pumping constant rate of\nfluid thru the membrane into the porous skeleton. Above certain values of\nthe rate we observe separation between the membrane and the skeleton. One\nsolution to this problem is applying a mechanical pressure to prevent the\ndelamination of the membrane.  While absolute values of the stress/pressure\ndoes not affect the fluid flow, absolute values do affect the delamination.\nI have already implemented a cohesive zone type model for the mass flux to\nstop if the interface separation is greater than a certain value. This is\nwhy I need  displacement coupling to the fluid flow.\n\nCapillary curve : completely understood about what 0 saturation is, and I\nwas just giving you an example of what the choice of initial conditions\nwill be.\n\nPumping end BCS, are currently fixed displacementn in direction normal to\nthe flow. The pore pressure will presumably come from a post processor. I\nam however confused as to how one can apply a Neumann and a Dirichlet bc\nfor the same variable at the same boundary. In this instance we have a\nporousflowsink and a pressure bc. I see the physical need for it, but\ncannot quite understand the implementation.\n\nThanks for your help to a newbie on porous flow mechanics.\n\nCheers\nSrinath\n\u2026\nOn Thu, Jun 16, 2022, 6:48 PM Andy Wilkins ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n    - Fluid boundary conditions at the \"far end\"....

          "bodyText": "Very new to Moose and porous flow modeling in general. I love the ease at which I can add and remove modules and while I have not gotten into it yet, I am sure I find writing my own kernals very beneficial. I have primarily used Elmer FEM previously and while it is great it is not as easily customized.\nI have been working my way through the porous flow tutorial and trying to setup a few scenarios of my own while I try to learn the different operators. At the end of the day I would like to set up a model with a vadose/saturated zone and single steam injection well. I understand this will be difficult to do, small timesteps and all that. The only user example I have been able to find of this came from the old Moose Google Group where somebody had set up a model for \"steam assisted gravity drainage\". The primary variables used in that were T and P - need enthalpy for the phase change.\nI thought I would set up a simple model with just hot water injection with P and h as the primary variables to get things started. My mesh is essentially a much much denser version of the 'cap/aquifer' mesh from the porous flow tutorial. I don't have any problems getting it to run until I add in the PorousFlowOutflowBC to the outer boundary of the model. I can get it to run for a period of time and then I start to get errors for the pressure being out of the range for water. For the timesteps it will converge, the pore pressure at the outflow boundary drops and rises and drops.\nI am sure I have set the input file up incorrectly. If somebody would be able to take a quick look and point me in the right direction I would be grateful.\n  [fmg]\n    type = FileMeshGenerator\n    file = InjectionWellSimple.msh\n  []\n[]\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  PorousFlowDictator = dictator\n  gravity = '0 0 0'\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [p]\n    initial_condition = 101325\n  []\n  [h]\n#    scaling = 1e-6\n  []\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [hic]\n    type = PorousFlowFluidPropertyIC\n    variable = h\n    porepressure = p\n    property = enthalpy\n    temperature = 293.15\n    fp = water #The 'fp' is the name of the user object.

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI\u2019m using the PorousFlow module to perform a simple steady-state darcy flow through a unit square model with displacement BC of 1e4 at the top and zero everywhere. The inlet has a NeumannBC of 10e-10kg/s, and the outlet has a pressure of 1MPa. After running the simulation and comparing the results with the benchmark study, I noticed that my pressure gradient was extremely low (also inaccurate). I\u2019m guessing the way I applied the NeumannBC on the inlet is not the best because the pressure gradient only changes when I change the pressure at the outer boundary (i.e., the legend shows the pressure gradient from the initial pressure condition to the outer pressure condition). Could someone please help? I attached my input file, an image of my result, and the benchmark.

My pore-pressure seems to be half that of the benchmark. I\u2019m guessing this might be due to the magnitude of my displacement. Not quiet sure because I assigned the proper displacement BCs. Also, my permeability looks a bit smaller (don't know if it is changing at all). Any suggestion? I\u2019m still working on it. I attached the results here:\nmy_results\n\nbenchmark",

In their literature, they used a density of 1kg/m3 instead of the usual density of water (i.e., 1e3 kg/m3) that we\u2019re familiar with and are using to compute the pressure gradient. That makes their mass flow rate equal to 1e10 kg/s. After making the changes, I got an almost exact value (see attached), but the magnitude of my permeability is still a bit off, although it is the same in the X and Y direction. I\u2019m still working on it. Thanks a lot!\nBenchmark= Left my_results =Right",

However, all tests failed with an error message:\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.26 not found\nAnalysis of the error is simple by:\nldd ./lib/libmoose_test-opt.so.0\nstrings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX\n\nThis shows easily, that the error message is just correct: libmoose links to a mixture of local libs (from miniconda) and system-wide libs. The systemwide glibc is indeed just a bit too old (it supports all up to GLIBCXX_3.4.25). For completeness: My system is Debian10, gcc 8.3.0, glibc 2.28\nSome quick research shows, that such issues are not unheard of in context of conda. There are a lots of proposed solutions, including some rather scary ones (like upgrading your whole system-wide glibc) or annoying ones (like applying patchelf to a lot of things).\nMy solution was inserting this into ~/miniconda3/envs/moose/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh:\nexport OLD_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\n\nand this into the corresponding ~/miniconda3/envs/moose/etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OLD_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\nunset OLD_LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nThe miniconda environment contains its own (newer) libstdc++ and now the linker prefers these libs.\nThis solves the main issue. All tests pass now. However, any call is accompagnied by this:\n/bin/bash: /home/hans/miniconda3/envs/moose/lib/libtinfo.so.6: no version information available (required by /bin/bash)\nMy questions are:\n\nIs this supposed to happen? Perhaps I am spoilt by how easy installing software usually is nowadays - but I suppose this should work out-of-the-box? What went wrong?\nIs my fix the recommended solution?\nAre there any pitfalls to be aware of with this?",

The fix went in only an hour or so ago manually into our Idaholab channel.\nA good list:\nmoose-libmesh             2021.06.30              build_1    idaholab\nmoose-libmesh-vtk         6.3.0                   build_6    idaholab\nmoose-mpich               3.3.2                   build_6    idaholab\nmoose-petsc               3.15.1                  build_1    idaholab\nmoose-tools               2021.07.13       py39h3dbc78d_0    idaholab\n\nWhat I think you might see for the error you are receiving:\nBad list (recorded from another post, hence the python differences):\nmoose-libmesh             2021.06.30              build_1    idaholab\nmoose-libmesh-vtk         6.3.0                   build_6    idaholab\nmoose-mpich               3.3.2                   build_6    idaholab\nmoose-petsc               3.15.1                  build_1    idaholab\nmoose-tools               2020.04.13       py37h734910c_0    idaholab\n\nThe fix was to moose-libmesh. Even though they look identical. The problem was with the internals of said package depending on a version of libnetcdf that the latest moose-tools was requesting. I simply fixed moose-libmesh specifically, and overwrote it on our Anaconda Idaholab channel (hence the identical name/version/build). In retrospect I probably should have bumped a version or build number. But I wanted to create the exact build our CI was going to build later (and it still hasn't).
