I let the installer initialise conda and it created the necessary .zshrc file for me. After that I could install MOOSE smoothly and even ran the step01 of DarcyThermoMech tutorial. Now the question is, am I going to face any problem in the future for using mambaforge instead of mambaforge3? Thanks again for all your help.",

However, this is the only difference between my 1st and 2nd attempt. Also, if I remember correctly, the cURL command did not initialise conda automatically.

See #19420 where adding nodal evaluations is a top priority. I agree with @GiudGiud that supplying a subdomain would alleviate the principal concern we've always had with \"nodal materials\", e.g. what happens at the intersection between multiple different materials. But by allowing the user to explicitly say what subdomain they want to associate with, that concern goes away",

The code is set to disallow generate_core_metadata = true with PatternedHexMeshGenerator object using PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator objects as pattern inputs.\nHowever, note that if using HexagonConcentricCircleAdaptiveBoundaryMeshGenerator instead of  PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator (basically just replacing the type), core metadata can now be generated. Not sure if this working as intended, either.",
