The input file is listed pasted.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"conflict with use_displaced_mesh = true\"? Where and why do you want to manipulate use_displaced_mesh yourself. We typically advise against that.\n\nAlso, since the algorithm I have is based on the total strain not the incremental strain, I added displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z' in [Materials/stress], will it possibly be inconsistent with ComputeFiniteStrain\n\nThis question along with the previous one are very difficult to answer in general. Please clarify:\n\nAre you dealing with small deformation or large deformation?\nIf large deformation, which strain/stress measures are you working with?\nWhy do you insist on computing the stress on the deformed configuration?\n\n\nAnd one last general question on the Executioner. In the output, there is usually a linear solver nested within a nonlinear one. I can understand that the nonlinear solver is to solve for displacement from the global stiffness matrix and the right hand side. What is the linear solver for?\n\nNo, the linear system is the traditional K u = f taught in old-school engineer classes. For a general nonlinear system, R(u) = 0, you need to iteratively update it (hence the nonlinear loop). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method\n\nI saw from previous discussion that the convergence issue is usually with the nonlinear solver and not the linear one and am having the same issue myself. What could possibly cause that?\n\nThis is again very difficult to answer because the cause of convergence issues can vary dramatically from problem to problem.

While that is suitable for highly idealised situations, you almost always need something more sophisticated when dealing with real geology and hydrostratigraphy, as you have found.\nYou will need to use an external meshing software package.  I have built many models of the subsurface, and have found that meshing often takes a significant fraction of the time spent modelling, so don't think that meshing is a trivial, quick task!\nSome people can get Cubit free, while others (like me) have to pay lots of $$$ for it.  There is a \"sibling\" product called coreform that has free aspects.  Many MOOSE people use the excellent and free tool called gmsh that works well for PorousFlow type of problems.  If you are going to be in this field for many years, you might like to make your own mesh-translation tools (between different formatting) and mesh-building tools, probably based on the exodus or VTK libraries, since none of the aforementioned packages easily handle subsurface hydrostratigraphy with faults and so on.\na",

I am using PorousFlow module, and the problem is that I cannot define fluid properties for each component, and it only accepts for phases. How I can define material property for each gas in my system since they are after all in the same phase. I was wondering if can be done with PorousFlow.\nThanks,\nSina",
