I would like to show them as continuous functions, like the variable type of FIRST, and LAGRANGE. Is there any auxkernel to do this? Or I must use a postprocessor?\nThanks!",

The rough idea is as follows:\nLet's say I apply \"HeatConduction\" kernels/bcs to describe the temperature of an object and what I wish to do is: When the object's overall temperature reaches 50 degree, I will turn off the heater object(or boundaries) and when the temperature drops below 0 degree, I will turn the heater back on. The switching process will repeat itself for a couple of times.\nI'm aware that there's a control object called \"ConditionalEnableControl\", but it seems like it will switch condition for only once, which is not suitable for my case. I'm perfectly fine with creating my own kernels/objects in Moose if that's necessary.\nAny help will be much appreciated!",

But if we have lots of threads and 1 MPI, for the threadJoin() function, we are not sure which threads calculate which elements. So we need to give the value of different threads to this main thread. After all the threadJoin() calculations, we could get a full map that can be used in Kernel, Material, and so on. In this case, finalize() is useless.\nIf we have lots of MPI, we do not know which MPI calculates which elements. In each MPI, we just get a part of the full map. So we need to gather all parts of the map together to construct a full map that can be used in Kernel, Material, and so on. So we need the finalize() function.\nIs that right?

You can modify the fluid compressibility to make the fluid stiffer. You can output the fluid density as AuxVariable to check the density in your simulation.\nPorousFlowTHM action uses PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative and assumes pressure as variable to solve. Furthermore standard in the action is that the mass balance is NOT multiplied by density (on both sides) which makes the equation linear and quasi-static in each timestep.\nOn the other hand if you use PorousFlowMassTimeDerivative, e.g. by using the PorousFlowUnsaturated Action, the equations solve for the density change and you have a \"real\" transient simulation.\nEDIT:\nThe best to fit you results might be to use PorousFlowTHM action and change the FluidProperties to a high bulk modulus (stiff water) and thermal_expansion to 0.",

I looked at the gmsh_io.C code, and I found that nodes are being added to nodesets for any 0-dimensional elements that are present in the mesh. For Gmsh files with version < 4.0, for example, we do the following:\n                // Handle 0-dimensional elements (points) by adding\n                // them to the BoundaryInfo object with\n                // boundary_id == physical.\n                else\n                {\n                  // This seems like it should always be the same\n                  // number as the 'id' we already read in on this\n                  // line.  At least it was in the example gmsh\n                  // file I had...\n                  in >> node_id;\n                  mesh.get_boundary_info().add_node\n                    (nodetrans[node_id],\n                     static_cast<boundary_id_type>(physical));\n                }\n\nIt also appears that we handle setting nodeset names based on the information in the PhysicalNames section.\n              // If it's zero-dimensional then it's a nodeset\n              else if (phys_dim == 0)\n                mesh.get_boundary_info().nodeset_name(cast_int<boundary_id_type>(phys_id)) = phys_name;\n\nSo I think that if @burritotukituki adds the nodes that he wants to be in a nodeset as zero-dimensional \"elements\" in the Gmsh file, then he might have more luck? I would also suggest that they provide a small version of the .msh file that is not working for them so that we can investigate further.",

          "bodyText": "Hi Everyone\nI have a question regarding a simple doublet reservoir modeling. In this simulation, I used 'PorousFlowPointSourceFromPostprocessor' and 'PorousFlowPointEnthalpySourceFromPostprocessor' for mass and energy injection and 'PorousFlowPolyLineSink' for energy/mass extraction. Now I have four questions:\n\nWhile 'PorousFlowPolyLineSink' allows for using point_file, it is not possible to set it in 'PorousFlowPointSourceFromPostprocessor'. So, I had to set it 9 times for 9 perforations of my injection well! How can I avoid this repetition?\nIs it possible to distribute flow over a line uniformly, without setting several points? If yes, can you refer to an input file implementing this?\nWhat is the point of setting line_length? I think we only care about line_length*flux and separating them seems to be meaningless.\nwhat happens when we set p_or_t_vals = 0.0?\n\nThank you in advance!
