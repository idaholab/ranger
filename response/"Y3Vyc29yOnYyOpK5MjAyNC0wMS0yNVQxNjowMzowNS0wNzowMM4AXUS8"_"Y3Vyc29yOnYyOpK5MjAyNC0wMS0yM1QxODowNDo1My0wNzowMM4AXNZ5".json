I want to compute (u_i A_{i,j} u_j) kernel where u is a variable, u_i is its spatial gradient, A_{i,j} is a second order tensor. Let's make A is an identity matrix.\nFor the computeResidual, I coded as:\nRankTwoTensor A(1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.);\n return _grad_u[_qp] *  A(_i, _j) * _grad_test[_i][_qp];\n\nAnd computeJacobian:\nRankTwoTensor A(1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.);\n return _grad_phi[_j][_qp] *  A(_i, _j) * _grad_test[_i][_qp];\n\nAre they correct? I have an issue of convergence with it.\nThanks,\nThai.",

Few possibilities:\n\nsimulate the borehole as filled with a fictitious porous very permeable material, with a quasi step-function water retention curve\nsimulate water in the borehole with as a fluid in an Eulerian mesh, copuled at the bottom with a lagrangian mesh of the soil, where the varying water flow at the bottom acts as a flux into the soil\n\n1 is feasible but i\u2019d rather go for 2 as it\u2019s more realistic and does not require fictitious material properties.\nIs there such a possibility in MOOSE?

This is fully-coupled.  Look at things like ParsedODEKernel, or PPValue, and (Coef)ODETimeDerivative.   Ideally, you want the Jacobian (derivative of height of water wrt the porepressures at the well screen) to be correct so your fully-coupled system converges nicely, otherwise you might be forced back to short timesteps.\nTry to make MOOSE to compute the coupling between variables in every non-linear step.\nTry this as an starting point\nhttps://github.com/josebastiase/TSA---Numerical-study/blob/main/Fig_7/S6/k10/Sim_files\nI hope this makes sense",

I'm simulating a simple falling head test, in plane strain, the soil column is 1 m wide, 10 m tall, and the initial water column in the well, at the top of the soil column, is 10 m.\nA zero porepressure is applied at the bottom at all times. Can you have a look at my input file? Please find it attached.\nI have convergence issues, the problem won't converge with default settings, if I increase nl_abs_tol to 1.E-8, for instance, it converges but mostly it does not iterate (which I assume means it's not solving anything). And when I manage to make it converge, the height of the water column h does not change during the analysis.\ntest.i.txt\nThanks,\nN",

I need someone to explain better how the execute_on flags work, as this seems to be the key issue.\nWith respect to the approach proposed by @josebastiase (many thanks) I tackled the problem in a simpler way, i.e. by using a simple Diffusion Kernel. As in the previous file, the rate of water level change in the borehole, dh/dt, is given by the flux Postprocessor, that is a NodalSum of nodal fluxes, saved into the AuxVariable fluxes by a CoupledVarNeumannBC. The latter uses another AuxVariable diff equal to pwp - wellPP at the boundary, where pwp is the nonlinear variable of the diffusion kernel, wellPP is an AuxVariable representing the pressure of the bottom of the borehole (set equal to the scalar variable h).\nI copied the entire Preconditioning block from Jose's example (no idea of what all those options are) but used a standard Executioner.\nNow, the only way to make all this stuff work was setting execute_on = 'TIMESTEP_BEGIN' for the flux Postprocessor, while for the AuxVariables diff and wellPP I also had to set execute_on = 'LINEAR NONLINEAR'. Can someone explain me why? Shouldn't I compute flux also during the iterations? If I do the analysis goes bananas.\nAlso, with this approach the flux is 0 at the first timestep, can I have it start with the correct value?\nThank you in advance\ntest2.i.txt",

Executing on linear is as often as possible, while you are solving the linear systems on every iteration.\nnonlinear is in between each newton / nonlinear iteration\ntimestep_begin is only once per time step. This is lagging the quantity, you freeze it at the beginning of the time step.\nThis decision on the execute_on flag can influence the time integration scheme convergence order. It also generally helps to lag things to get convergence. It s a double edged sword\nGuillaume",

          "bodyText": "Hi MOOSE community,\nI've been working on a problem involving two nested grids recently. I've learned that CoarseMeshExtraElementIDGenerator can help establish a mapping between coarse and fine grid elements. However, besides the mapping between elements, I'm interested in preserving some additional information about the coarse grid.\nI'm curious about whether the coarse grid can still be accessed after leaving the Mesh block. Specifically, I'd like to know if its memory is released, and if MOOSE only retains information about the fine grid.\nAdditionally, I'm wondering if there's a way to pass data structures, like std::vector, between different kernels in MOOSE. I'm considering saving the coarse grid information in a vector or another suitable form and then inputting it into the required object. If using std::vector directly, I'm unsure about how to declare it in the input file (input.i). I've thought about creating a custom user object to store this information, but I'm not sure how to handle its execute and other functions since I don't need it to perform any calculations.\nAny insights or guidance on these questions would be greatly appreciated!\nThank you,\nhityyds",

The only thing is the weight is not the same on secondary nodes.\n\nYou can see that in the rbe3, the load applied on the main node is distributed on the selected surface. However, the load applied depends on the position of the secondary nodes vs the main node. So I need to retrieve the nodes on the selected boundaries (or node set in this case?) and compute the weight associated to each node.",

I'm interested in understanding the rationale behind setting weights as 1/N in the context of LinearNodalConstraint. Could you provide more clarity on the reasons behind this choice?\nIt would be beneficial to have a nodal constraint that mimics the function of the RBE3s (Nastran naming) / distributing coupling (Abaqus) directly from the source code.",

RBE3/distributing coupling satisfies the constraint in an average sense, the weights are therefore uniformly distributed among the slave nodes. In the notation of LinearNodalConstraint that corresponds to weights of 1/N. As stated by the Abaqus user manual, there are alternative ways of distributing the weights, e.g., linear/quadratic decay as a function of master/slave distance.\nNeither rigid body rotation nor higher order weights are implemented in LinearNodalConstraint. But as I said, LinearNodalConstraint should be a good place to start. Pull requests are welcome, but a careful benchmarking with either Nastran or Abaqus will be preferred.",
