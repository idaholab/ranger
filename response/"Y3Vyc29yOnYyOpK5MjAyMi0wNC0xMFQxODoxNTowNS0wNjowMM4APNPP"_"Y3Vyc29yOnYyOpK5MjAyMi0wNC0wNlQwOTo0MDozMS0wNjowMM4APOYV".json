          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE Users,\nI am trying to implement an AuxKernel that calculates the directional derivative of an array variable.\nFor this purpose, I am using the coupledArrayGradient that I saw in one example in the MOOSE framework postprocessors.\nHowever, there is no example where such a coupled gradient is actually used,\nnot just imported, in the code in the entire MOOSE,\ntherefore I have doubt about how to use it, specifically, how to access the individual components of the gradient.\nLet's say I have:\n_grad_variable(coupledArrayGradient(\"gradient_variable\"))\nI assume the first index should the quadrature point, so:\n_grad_variable[_qp]\nand the second index should be in round parenthesis to pick the gradient of a specific variable in the vector array, like:\n_grad_variable[_qp](i)\nIs this correct? Or i means the 3D component, like x,y,z, along which I am taking the gradient?\nHow do I access the individual components?\nYou can check my class here:\nhttps://github.com/ngrilli/c_pfor_am/blob/main/src/auxkernels/ArrayDirectionalDerivative.C\nRight now I assign the expression _grad_variable[_qp](i) to a RealVectorValue\nand extract the components with round parenthesis,\nI would like to know what is the best strategy in your opinion and if what I am doing is correct.\nSpecifically, since I need the directional derivative, I would need the scalar product between _grad_variable[_qp](i)\nand a std::vector<Real>. What is the best strategy for this.\nYour suggestions are highly appreciated.\nHope this can be helpful for others as I could not find any discussion here\nwith keyword coupledArrayGradient.\nThank you very much in advance.\nBest Regards,\nNicol\u00f2",

If you have your own app, it's just a matter of dropping it into the right directory in your App and our system will automatically pick it up, register it, and let you use it. While setup and tear down is a normal operation, we don't have a lot of need for that in our integration test suite. Note that if you use Gtest for \"component\" level testing, you can create those methods like you'd expect.\nWhat are you trying to do? Can you just soft link those files into the right locations so you don't have to setup and tear down? Maybe we can come up with other ways of solving your problem.",

I did go with @milljm 's first suggestion in the end, and it worked for me.\nHowever, I do agree this is a bit of an 'abuse' of the system that should be moved to the more robust solution of writing a bespoke Tester as suggested by @permcody . My use case was a slightly abnormal one: the input file for an externally run program (called from an ExternalProblem class) also functioned as the output file for that external program. So, a simple symlink won't work because the input file will have changed by the end of the test run, making it unsuitable for future use. This is why I needed the proper clone copy.",
