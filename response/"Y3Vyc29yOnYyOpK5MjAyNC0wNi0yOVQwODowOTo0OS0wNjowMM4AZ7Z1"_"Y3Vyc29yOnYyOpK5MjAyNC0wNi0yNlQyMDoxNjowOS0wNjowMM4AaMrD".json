My proposed program would used more of the kernel developed in Navier Stoke and PorousFlow Modules with certain modification. The The Darcy Brinkman formulation is a sig=ngle pressure field equation that couple Navier stoke and Darcy into one equation. In the matrix the the reduces to darcy, as you go from porous region to solid region such as in vugs or fracture,  the equation asymptotically reduces to Navier stoke flow.\nI have attached below a figure of my proposed media, and research paper of this implementation in OPENFOAM.  II like to replicate this in MOOSE with improvement to capture slightly compressible flow that is applicable to CO2 storage in fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir. I believe that MOOSE's capabilities are well-suited for this task, particularly with its flexibility and robustness in handling multiphysics problems.\nMultiphase flow modeling in multiscale porous media.pdf\n\n\nAny specific guidance on how to implement the Darcy Brinkman formulation within the MOOSE framework? Additionally, I would appreciate any insights or best practices that could streamline the development process and ensure accurate simulation results.",

Would the variables be velocity, phi and pressure?\nOnce you have identified the variables, you should decide which discretization to use. Both modules have a continuous galerkin finite element and a finite volume implementation that can serve as examples.\nThe paper mentions two flow regimes can be present, Darcy and NS flow. Do you plan to have the same equation over the entire domain and the flow regime naturally lets some terms be important and others be negligible ?\nWe have tutorials on creating new applications here:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.html\nChris will have more targeted advice\nGuillaume",

However, this information will be similar to what you have seen in paraview.\nBecause the stress-update based crystal plasticity code is written to refer to the reference configuration, we only calculate the rotation of the Rank-4 elasticity tensor once at the beginning of the simulation. Updates to the rotation matrix are computed in the ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress class https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/modules/solid_mechanics/src/materials/crystal_plasticity/ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress.C#L315-L317\n@dewenyushu do you have insights into how to update the Rank-4 elasticity tensor from the _updated_rotation[_qp] Rank-2 tensor?",
