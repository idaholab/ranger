          "bodyText": "Hi Moose community,\nI am solving a simple thermo-elastic problem with the following temperature profile for a simple cube ( a linearly varying temperature from 0-200 along z):\n\nFor this I am also giving a temperature independent and isotropic CTE of 1e-4 and a stress free temperature of 100 C. So in that case the eigenstrain should be 1e-4*(T-100) thus ranging between -0.01 to 0.01. However, when I see the moose results i see at the boundaries the value is +/- 0.0095 instead of +/- 0.01. What is the reason for this discrepancy?\n\nAlso the line profile (across the mid-cube along z) looks like this:\n\nClearly, there is a slope change at the boundary.\nFollowing is my input

But I found the  convergence is not good when the velocity is low(about 0.1 m/s).  As far as I know, SIMPLE method also has this problem. But SIMPLE can solve the case whose velocity is about 0.01 m/s(can't be lower). In MOOSE, the solving method is PJFNK. I'm wondering if there is some numerical methods in MOOSE which can help and solve this problem.\nEthan",

For the x direction I have set the force on the left side of the model and fixed the x displacement to be zero on the right side. For y, the force is on the backside while on the front side  y displacement is zero. For z, the stress BC is on the top while the z displacement is zero on the bottom. I have also set three pressure BCs on the left side, back side and right side of the model. When I run the model, the pressure BCs in the surrounding three surfaces of the model drops the pressure value (~ 2MPa) inside the model. How can I avoid it? The following fig shows the simulation in time -29 days (I started from -30 days to maybe reach the equilibrium at time 0):\n\nThe line plot is passing through a depth of 1055 m and I expect a ~ 10 MPa pressure but in the model the pressure is dropping.\nMy input file and mesh are uploaded to this repository: https://github.com/Ali1990dashti/input_file_for_PF\nI very much appreciate any help.",
