The Problem I'm facing is following error\n*** ERROR ***\n'calc_sense' already obtained a writable reference to 'dV'. Only one object can obtain such a reference per variable and subdomain in a simulation.\n\nThe workflow of the simulation is:\n\nCalculate the initial value of a scalar and an elemental AuxVariable in a UserObject and write them. The elemental AuxVariable uses a WritableVariable reference.\nRead the value from the elemental AuxVariable in a second UserObject, do some modifications and write it back using a WritableVariable reference once again (which is where the error occurs).\nRead both the scalar and the elemental AuxVariable again for the final computation.\n\nIs there a way to get this working as it is? Or do I have to split my UserObject into an AuxScalarKernel and an elemental AuxKernel?",

But then as I realised a lot of the examples on the MOOSE website run with the directory titled 'projects', I changed the name back. But even still, I was able to compile the first three examples in projects/moose/examples after doing this and they all worked perfectly fine? So how can I get the tutorial examples to work/compile?\nNote: I changed the 'projects' directory back to 'projects_MOOSE' and then tried to compile the step01_diffusion application again, and got a slightly different error message (see below).

See https://github.com/doquang/slip_flow. It seems to work for the low Re case (rho=400), but doesn't converge for the rho=1000 case. I'm wondering,\n\nIs the way I'm doing it correct?\nIf correct, is there any way to improve convergence?\nFor the working cases (rho=400). I still see some normal flow through the surface 100. Is that acceptable?\n\nThanks!",

As you implied, getting PETSc and libMesh built wasn't a problem, but I think propagating the fact that Number is how a complex quality through all of our typedefs and templated methods was just a huge lift. My memory tells me that I started that conversion process, and I think I got hung up on the Residual and Jacobian methods and how to properly populate the matrices. I'm still interested in doing the work, but I might need to apply for some funding to have time to do it. It'll become more important to have that capability in future fusion projects I think.",
