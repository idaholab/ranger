          "bodyText": "Hello all,\nI am working to validate the crystal plasticity module against a shear strain problem a colleague calculated with another code. The BCs are a high strain rate on the top, 20 MPa pressure on top, no x displacement in the lower left ,and no y displacement on lower right, as shown in the first image below. What ends up happening is the lower left pin pulls away from the rest of the domain, as shown in the second image. The material properties and BCs nearly match the problem I am validating against, the only exception is that the problem I am validating against uses Periodic BCs. When I apply periodic BCs to the displacement variables then all stress/strain is resolved and there is no evolution.\nI have not seen any example problems using Crystal Plasticity in MOOSE that uses periodic BCs, are they simply inappropriate when solving for displacement? Does anyone have any insight or suggestions about what could be causing the overall behavior I am seeing?\nThanks,\nFloyd",

At a point, it does not converge:\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the object \"tabulated_water95\", of type \"TabulatedBicubicFluidProperties\".\nTemperature 1643.76 is outside the range of tabulated temperature (273.17, 1400).\n\n\nThis value (1643.76) is way beyond the common values I have after convergence. I am wondering how to locate the node having this issue. Please, any suggestion?\nJavier",

Then in that object you can set the output parameters to output to exodus\nNote that returning an error for out of range is not what we should be doing here. We created the solution Invalid interface to avoid crashing simulations on out of range errors.",

This will never be obtained in the actual implementation in moose!  The instruction : hist_variable = _barrier[_qp]; should never be executed means invoked. This used to happen (before our correction suggestion) when _use_snes_vi_solver = true (and the correct bounds for the Executioner block).\nSo in summary, the older version was fine in the unique case of    considering a barrier and using snes solver.  When  _use_snes_vi_solver = false;  the bandwidth could be 20*Lc.\nwith the correction we have suggested, whenever we have a barrier (with or without use of the snes solver) , the bandwidth is too large.\nSo in case of linear fracture energy, the snes solver has to be mandatory.  So the code should be something like this:\n if (_barrier)\n_use_snes_vi_solver = true; \n\nif (_use_snes_vi_solver)\n  {\n    _H[_qp] = F_pos;\n\n    if (_use_current_hist)\n      hist_variable = _H[_qp];\n  }",
