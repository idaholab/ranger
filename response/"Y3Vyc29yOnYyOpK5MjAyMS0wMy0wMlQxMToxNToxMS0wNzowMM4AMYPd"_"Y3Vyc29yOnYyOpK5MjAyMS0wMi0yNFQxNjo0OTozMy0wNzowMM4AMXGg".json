You can get a free copy of Coreform Cubit Learn for non-commercial use, or a free-trial of Coreform Cubit for commercial use by following the links below.  Once you have Coreform Cubit, there are several options for mesh generation - tetrahedral meshing, multi-block hex-meshing, or automatic \"sculpt meshing\" which is particularly useful for complex material science meshes -- see images below.\nAbout Coreform Cubit https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/\nCoreform Cubit Learn: https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/free-meshing-software/\nCoreform Cubit trial: https://coreform.com/products/trial/\nI'm happy to help any questions you may have regarding Coreform Cubit meshing.\nBest regards,\nGreg Vernon\nDirector of Product Management\nCoreform LLC\nImages\n\n\nTetrahedral meshing\n\n\n\nMulti-block hex-meshing\n\n\n\nSculpt automatic hex-meshing",

Both versions will work well, however, and at present more constitutive models are available in the user-object version (e.g. Voce model). We are working on transitioning these models to the material-based version, and any new constitutive models we add will be only in the material-based Update version.\nThe material-based Update version has been developed to have a complete constitutive model within a material class. This implementation more closely aligns with the descriptions of a constitutive model that one might read in a journal article. This collection of all the constitutive model details within a material class has a couple of main benefits:\n\nMore direct storage of state variables (e.g. slip system resistance), and our initial results show some speed up with the material-based version\nEasier to modify and implement new constitutive models\n\nHope this helps!",

The mesh variable that the Function will pick up are heat flux values that will be coming from a subapp that calls an external program.\nIn case a diagram makes this a bit more clear (arrows are loosely the flow of data I would like):",

The heat fluxes are coming from the fast ions emitted by a plasma. These are the values that will be returned by the external program.\n\nAre your main/sub-app meshes on the same scale?\n\nSpatial scale, yes. Time scale is still in the process of being determined. It is likely that the external program will run through a number of its own internal, smaller time steps and then return the heat flux at the end of the longer \"global\" time step for the MultiApp.\n\nHow is the \"heat_flux\" defined in the sub-application?\n\nNot sure of this because I have not actually had access to the external program yet. I appreciate that probably limits the advice you can give, but basically I have been trying to do as much on the MOOSE side of things while I wait for access.\n\nTypically this type of value would be computed as an AuxVariable, if this is the case then you transfer the variable directly from the sub-app to the main using the MultiAppCopyTransfer (if your two problems are on the same mesh).\n\nIt is quite likely the meshes will not be the same, but again, I need to see what the external program capabilities are and how it accepts a mesh. Presumably, I can design my MOOSE application such that it passes a mesh which is compatible with the external program, and therefore they will be on the same mesh.\nOnce I have the AuxVariable, how can that be used in a Neumann BC?\nMany thanks for the reply!",

If that version number leads with 2020.12.xx then we need to force the update to the newest version. In your moose environment, run the command conda install moose-libmesh=2021.02.15 which will force an update to the newest version of libmesh. Then perform a clean (make clobberall) and try to make again.\nTL;DR on the thread below:\nThis ended up being three main things...\n(1) An out-of-date moose-libmesh package causing the original compile issue\n(2) An out-of-date conda channel (https://mooseframework.org/conda/moose) which needed to be updated to idaholab\n(3) root user ownership of ~/.conda, which needs to be owned by the regular user in order to manipulate environments.\nAs a general reminder to all users - do not use sudo while making changes or updates to conda if it is installed in your home directory! It can cause permissions issues that can lead to a broken or partially-broken conda installation.",
