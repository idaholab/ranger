                  "bodyText": "Depends on the system... Homebrew is usually a Macintosh user thing, so what you want to change might actually be your ZSH profile. In either case, if you are using Bash these files (and others) are directly located in your $HOME directory:\n(some files may not exist)\n~/.bashrc         # BASH \n~/.bash_profile   # BASH\n~/.profile        # BASH I've seen Homebrew stick things here sometimes\n~/.zshrc          # Zsh\nWhy so many BASH profiles? I think the man page sums it up best (scroll down to \"INVOCATION\").\nHopefully you are using Zsh. As its a bit less complicated. You can verify what shell your terminal defaults to by running the following command (my machine spits back -zsh):\n\u276f echo $0\n-zsh\nIf you are using a GUI file manager, these files (and others which begin with a period) are hidden. They are also likely hidden without using additional listing arguments to ls. Example:\n\u276f mkdir ~/temp; cd ~/temp\n\u276f touch .hidden\n\u276f ls\n\n\u276f ls -a\n.       ..      .hidden",

What do I execute app3_sub1 on?\nQ2) Perhaps Picard (fixed-point) iteration, as you suggested is the way to go to ensure proper coupling between the variables before moving to the next time step.

However, in order to meet the requirements of my thesis proposal, I need to use the Method of Lines approach instead. Can you tell me if this is possible with the framework?",

The functional derivative of concentration can be regarded as chemical potential, and the difference between Cahn Hilliard equation and the surface tension term is that the former is \\nebla (\\M*\\nebla miu) while in equation 2 is \\phi*\\ nebla miu (although strictly speaking, only the functional derivative of energy with respect to concentration can be called chemical potential).\nI wonder if I can still use the SplitCHParsed kernel (although )with some other kernels to solve this term or should I write a new one?",

I am not sure how that path is being made relevant during make of hound.\nHowever, I am finding the following in the log relating to slurm:\n/usr/bin/gcc -I/shared/apps/.gcc/8.3/openmpi/4.0.5/include -fexceptions -pthread -L/shared/apps/.gcc/8.3/hwloc/2.4.1/lib -L/opt/slurm/current/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/shared/apps/.gcc/8.3/hwloc/2.4.1/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/opt/slurm/current/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/shared/apps/.gcc/8.3/openmpi/4.0.5/lib -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -L/shared/apps/.gcc/8.3/openmpi/4.0.5/lib -lmpi\n\nSpecifically:\n-L/opt/slurm/current/lib\nI think perhaps some part of MOOSE was built while on a different machine, where /opt/slurm/20.02.5 was available, but no longer. Did you perchance build some of the MOOSE dependencies/MOOSE itself while on a headnode for your cluster?",
