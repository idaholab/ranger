I keep getting the error:  \"Could NOT find llvm-config executable and LIBCLANG_CXXFLAGS is not set\". How should I fix this problem?\nUpdate:  I was able to resolve this issue by installing llvm with \"sudo apt-get install llvm\". However, now I am getting the error: \" Failed to compile small clang test app. It's likely that the include file <clang-c/Index.h> could not be found! Maybe you need to install the clang development package (delete the CMakeCache.txt file before trying to run cmake again after installation)?.\"\nI have tried the following: \"sudo apt-get install llvm-dev\", \" sudo apt install clang\", \"sudo apt-get install clang\", \"sudo apt-get install libclang-dev\", but the error persists.

My understanding is that it's the total because for example in the CH equation you have df_chem/dc and dE_d/dc and so you supply the total energy to the SplitCHParsed kernel.\nBut for KKS problems, in the examples that I've seen, the CH kernels take just the chemical energies rather than the total. Is that because the free energy is differentiated with respect to the phase concentrations (rather than total), so other terms drop out? And as for the AC equation, it seems to matter if doing KHS or VTS interpolation? See here and here.\nCan someone help me understand how to properly use the chemical potential?",

For a KKS simulation you would have an elastic energy E which might depend on the global concentration variables. You need to apply the chain rule to compute the derivative of the elastic energy w.r.t the phase concentrations. In pure phase regions those derivatives would vanish for the inactive phases (as their phase concentration do not contribute to the global concentration because their switching function is zero). Within interfaces you'd have contributions from all phases. BUT, if I'm not mistaken, due to the linearity of the dependence of the global concentration on the phase concentrations you can basically take the derivative of the mechanical energy w.r.t the global concentration and multiply it with each phase's switching function to get the mechanical chemical potential contribution for that phase.",

They also use the same interfacial concentration partition condition, which is assuming the same chemical potential across the interface. So I would say they are similar enough that the same logic of handling the elastic energies can apply, just that GPM doesn't need to solve for phase concentration variables. The downside of GPM is that inverting the chemical and elastic energies from concentration-dependent to chemical potential-dependent can be a pain sometimes, so the energy form used in GPM is restricted. In terms of the WBM, since the interfacial concentration is defined in a different way, I am unsure if the same logic can be applied. Either way, interesting topic and good luck.",

So, in that case when you take the derivative of the elastic energy term w.r.t. concentration you get zero- meaning only the chemical energy contributes to chemical potential for both VTS and KHS schemes. The elastic strain energy term affects the evolution equation for the order parameter though.\nIf you wanted to consider a concentration-dependent eigenstrain, it's not totally clear to me off-hand whether you would include the elastic energy contribution when setting up the chemical potential constraint. It would really only be feasible for the VTS scheme, because in the VTS scheme there is a per-phase elastic energy defined. Whereas in the KHS scheme there is a global elastic energy defined and it isn't really separated out on a per-phase basis. Since more authors in the literature have used the KHS scheme, I would guess most have not included an elastic energy contribution to the chemical potential constraint equation.",

I do indeed have a concentration-dependent eigenstrain so you understand the problem I'm trying to navigate.\nLooking at the KKS KHS example example, I see how the global elastic energy term gets added to the AC equation. I suppose I could do something similar for the CH equation. In addition, I could also define some DerivativeSumMaterials that combine my chemical and elastic energies for each phase, and use those as the free energies in the chemical potential constraint. The only problem is that I'm not sure what the \"right\" solution looks like.\nI see in the KKS VTS example that you combined the chemical and elastic energies in each phase, but is that out of necessity or no?

So I think you would be safe to do that, but I'm not sure it's fundamentally the right answer. What about trying it both ways and comparing the result for some simple test cases? You could even do something similar to our 2017 paper and the test cases we did there. It would be interesting to see which approach affected the interfacial energy the most; that is probably the right way to assess which approach works best, figure out which results in an interfacial energy that is closest to the values you set as input parameters. This could be the basis of a pretty interesting follow-on paper to the 2017 paper, actually...",

Maybe your mesh is very coarse during your initial step, which leads to large residuals.\nTo test your code and make sure the transition to mesh adaptivity goes smoothly, I suggest doing it step by step from a simple input file that runs well without mesh adaptivity.\nOnce you have that, you could introduce one level of mesh adaptivity. In your mesh block, introduce a mesh that is twice as coarse (nx and ny defined as half of what you were using without mesh adaptivity for a 2D mesh) and add uniform_refine = 1. This line will uniformly refine your mesh once, thus creating the same mesh that you had in the input file without mesh adaptivity. Then, to introduce mesh adaptivity, and define your mesh adaptivity block as\n[./Adaptivity]\ninitial_adaptivity = 1\ninterval = 1\nrefine_fraction = 0.9\ncoarsen_fraction = 0.1\nmax_h_level = 1\n[../]\n\nNotice as I defined max_h_level = 1 instead of 4, since we want to introduce only one level of mesh adaptivity. If you check your mesh, some parts might be twice coarse as the uniform mesh you had without mesh adaptivity.\nLet me know if this solves your issue. If it does, you can progressively increase the number of mesh adaptivity levels by increasing initial_adaptivity and max_h_level.",

          "bodyText": "Dear all,\nFirstly, a big thank to the MOOSE community for the this incredible tool. I appreciate the complete documentation, in particular PorousFlow's which is quite good.\nI'm running a medium-size simulation with PorousFlow that includes different types of BCs and sinks. It works really well (despite it took me a while to make it converge). Nonetheless, while reading my results I found an odd behavior in the mass balance. To illustrate this, I have set a simple input file. The system has a PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink on the left side which increases the porepressure. The simulation runs for ten seconds while the fluid flux and water balance are computed in post with NodalSum and PorousFlowFluidMass respectively. Now, I would expect that the total fluid going into the system (computed as fluid flux times timestep) would match the fluid balance. But it looks like very different results are obtained (as you may see if you run the simulation). Most likely is a units confusion but I can't figure where is it.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1quHSxTuHVNsq_um5lmEkEqWxtlONMFN1/view?usp=sharing\nThanks!\nJhon",

While you can reconcile everything (remember BasicTHM works with fluid volumes, not fluid masses), if you are using Sinks and wanting to look at mass balances, i strongly recommend using PorousFlowFullySaturated.  Then you don't have to think!  All you need to is change PorousFlowBasicTHM to PorousFlowFullySaturated in your input file.  Debug your model using FullySaturated, and then maybe go back to BasicTHM for production runs if you need ultimate speed.",

One example that may be of particular interest to the MOOSE community is one that automates a MOOSE parameter-sweep study.  While not incredibly sophisticated, I hope that it might at least be insightful for those looking to automate their MOOSE simulation workflows.\nIf interested, here's a link to register for the webinar.\nHope to see you in the webinar!\nGreg Vernon | Director of Product Management\nCoreform LLC",
