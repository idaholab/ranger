I do not need to explicitly add the DirichletBC or any BC at all for this boundary, since the boundary is receiving temperature values from the data transfer (where we specify to_boundaries = \"innerpipe\"). Is this right? But I see in your example you have a BC in the parent app, but I guess this is to account for the extra physics caused by the gap between parent and THM.\n(2) Do you have any idea how to get the boundary heat flux for the parent app for a general geometry? The SideDiffusiveFluxIntegral seems to be perfect, but only returns a single value (the integral). I cannot really tell in the code where the integral is computed (seems to be abstracted to something else, when I look at the functions computeQpIntegral, the outputs seem they should be a scalar at each qp.",

Otherwise, LayeredSideDiffusiveFluxAverage will account for faces in a completely different part of the domain (but still part of the innerpipe boundary).\nPretty much want I want is an aux field that is 0 everywhere except the innerpipe boundary, where I then just have $n \\cdot k \\nabla T$.\nThe average of the nearby elements (on the parent app) will then computed within MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestLocationTransfer and sent to our THM like so:\n#parent app\n[Transfers]\n  [temp_from_parent_to_child]\n    type = MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestLocationTransferWithDistanceWeightedAverage\n    # type = MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestLocationTransfer\n    to_multi_app = flow_channel\n    distance_weighted_average = true\n    source_variable = temp \n    from_boundaries = \"innerpipe\"\n    variable = q_wall \n    num_nearest_points = 200\n  []\n[]\n\n#THM app \n[Components]\n  [hxconn]\n    type = HeatTransferFromExternalAppHeatFlux1Phase\n    flow_channel = pipe1\n    Hw = water-htc-function\n    P_hf = 0.1\n  []\n[]",

Maybe this is a useful jumping off point:\nThe tricky part of this seems to be mapping the heat flux to THM. If we find something like the maximal inscribed sphere at each node (or element centroid) on the THM, we have a way to find the faces that will contribute heat flux to each THM element (we dilate the sphere a bit to ensure the relevant boundary nodes are contained within the sphere). We then find the weighted mean flux and assign this to the THM element (in a similar way that HeatTransferFromHeatFlux will assign a uniform heat flux to the flow channel).\nThis is related to finding the centerline/medial axis of a complex geometry (see VMTK documentation).\nDoes it sound like it would work?",

This already has support for n-nearest points, so I just set this to a moderate value (e.g. 10-20, depending on mesh density) to find the average of all nearby nodes in the 3D domain.

I am writing to seek assistance regarding an error I encountered while conducting a profiling analysis using MOOSE.\nI utilized the command MOOSE_PROFILE_BASE=run1_ mpiexec -np 35 /home/pw-moose/projects/moose/modules/phase_field/phase_field-oprof -i grain_growth_2D_graintracker.i to run my simulation, which resulted in the generation of a series of run1_*.prof files. However, when attempting to analyze one of these files using the pprof run1.prof command, I encountered the following error:\nUsing remote profile at run1.prof.\nUse of uninitialized value $line in substitution (s///) at /home/pw-moose/miniforge/envs/moose/bin/pprof line 3326.\nhttp://run1.prof/pprof/symbol doesn't exist\n\nI have referred to the instructions provided on the MOOSE website, particularly the section on profiling (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/application_development/profiling.html), for guidance on conducting the profiling analysis.\nCould you please advise on the possible reasons for this error and how I can resolve it? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you very much for your assistance.\nBest regards,\nWei",

However, I've noticed that running pprof -top on the specified profiling data takes a long time, and I'm seeking ways to optimize or understand the underlying cause of this delay.\nI have created a new issue #27467 on the forum to address this specific challenge. I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have on how to reduce the execution time or any related experiences you could share.\nThank you in advance for your time and help.\nBest regards,\nWei",

You'll know this is the case if you also get the error After reducing the stepsize to XXXX with original strain increment with L2norm YYYY  the returnMap algorithm failed (where XXXX and YYYY depend on your problem).  The problem is that MOOSE cannot figure out the solution to the return-map process, which almost always means: (a) there is no solution because your plastic parameters, such as softening/hardening parameters, are not chosen wisely; or (b) your stresses are so extreme that you're getting precision loss, which can happen during the Newton procedure, and you might be able to choose different timestep sizes or damping parameters to avoid this; or (c) the stresses are in a configuration that i haven't coded for, which is my mistake.\n\n\nDuring initialization.  You'll know this is the case when you don't get the aforementioned After reducing... error.  Choose debug_fspb = none to remove this error.\n\n\nBy the way, this error, particularly in case 2, could mean your initial stresses are inadmissible, which is potentially very bad, as some of the plasticity algorithms assume they are admissible, but your model might still produce reasonable results if you're lucky - you'll have to assess that for yourself.\nProbably unrelated to this thread, but i wanted to mention it while i remember: I'm pretty sure you're changing the Young's modulus to simulate tunnel excavation.  Make sure you have one initial timestep with it set to its unmodified value, otherwise you'll be getting the wrong answer.  I can explain why in another discussion thread, but, if your elasticity_tensor_prefactor = if(t>0,1E-3,1) just make sure you have start_time=-1 dt=1 or something like that.",

Eventually you'll want to set them different, but for your debugging dil=fric is a much easier problem to solve for MOOSE.\nChoose different yield_function_tolerance, internal_constraint_tolerance and ep_plastic_tolerance.  yield_function_tolerance should usually be set lower than any meaningful stresses.  Eg, if your stresses are measured in Pascals, then yield_function_tolerance = 1E-7 is fine, since it means \"1E-7 Pascals is a small number\".  Do not set it too low, because MOOSE may run out of precision, but do not set it too high (like your value of 100) because it allows MOOSE to be too lazy and your stresses will end up being crazy at some stage.  I usually start at 1E-14 * youngs_modulus, and then move downwards to see if MOOSE can still solve the problem.  ep_plastic_tolerance should be set at around yield_function_tolerance divided by youngs_modulus, but no lower than 1E-12, otherwise you'll loose precision.  internal_constraint_tolerance is usually less important, but should certainly be set less than your current value of 100.  Currently you're saying \"measure plastic strain with an accuracy of 100\", which is obviously not optimal, since your hardening occurs over the region to 0.01.  So use something like 1E-12 for this parameter (but don't panic - this parameter doesn't usually make much difference to the final results).\nTry using DruckerPrager plasticity.  It's numerically easier than MC.",

          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI'm working on the evolution of supercritical conditions by a magmatic intrusion at depth (7km), so the permeability (k) changes with the evolution of this high temperature body (825K).\nI implement an equation to calculate k as function of temperature following the equation of Hayba & Ingebritsen (1997). I include it using the permeability as PorousFlowPermeabilityTensorFromVar that call an AuxKernel and its AuxVariable.\nThe problem is that it doesn't converge. May be because  the permeability has a big change (k = [1e-22, 1e-14]), which is at the middle bottom of the mesh in a very short volume, that is, around the intrusion of magma (825K, k = 1e-22). So the Jacobian has a wide range of values to deal.\nI tried:\n\nRefine the mesh\nSmooth the BC of the intrusion of 825K\nSmooth the equation that computes the permeability\nModify the Executer, Preconditions and time steps\nInclude controls to start the BC of the intrusion late, after some timesteps\nInclude Controls to start the calculation of k after some timesteps after the starting of the intrusion\nInclude and Adaptivity, but I cannot use k as variable (and spend a lot of time running)\n\nMay be I can calculate k as a MultiApp, or can I calculate outside and call the results later (but I don't know how to do it and I didn't found anything in the discussions).\nAnother question that I have is why the size of the initial execution of this simulation is more than 2Gb (2368 MB) if only runs 3570 elements in 2D.\nHere is the project  with the mesh and the script with no Controls and Adaptivity\nAny support and comment to improve it are more than welcome",

I am generally following resources provided by Microsoft, and you can find what I am following here.\nI would start by removing the distribution you have installed. First, list the distributions you have available (you likely only have one) by running the command wsl -l -v in your Command Prompt. You should see distribution names. Pick the one you want to remove (in this case your Ubuntu install) and run wsl --unregister <DistributionName>, replacing <DistributionName> with the name for the Ubuntu installation on your machine.\nAt this point, I think you can try wsl --install to get a new default distribution or installing distributions from the Microsoft Store. Once you have a properly set up WSL instance, you should proceed with the rest of the MOOSE WSL instructions to make sure everything is properly updated and ready to install MOOSE packages.",
