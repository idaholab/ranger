I need to know which elements each Node or dof belongs to, and then do special handling as appropriate. So how can I get these messages when the pointer to the Node or dof is known?\nThank you very much for your attention and I would quite appreciate it if you have any suggestion!",

I have followed the instructions provided at https://mooseframework.inl.gov/ncrc/applications/ncrc_develop_griffin.html, with one addition. git submodule update --init was skipping the griffin_data submodule, so in addition to git submodule update --init, I also ran git submodule update --checkout, which appears to have successfully downloaded the data. I am working on the INL HPC.\nHowever, I am failing 15 tests. They seem to fall into one of three categories. Below, I have provided the names of the tests that have failed for each identical error message, and below that, I have included one of the failed tests' outputs. Each named test corresponding to a given number has failed with the same type of error.\n1 Tests\nxs_generation.base/cross_section_generation ..................................................

However, if I use mpiexec -n 5  ./app_name -i case_name_main.i,  it will cost 5478 seconds. Further, if I use mpiexec -n 10  ./app_name -i case_name_main.i, it will cost 18124 seconds.\nWhy does using more computing core not cause a decrease in computation time, but result in more computation time? Shouldn't parallel computing improve computational efficiency?\nThanks!",
