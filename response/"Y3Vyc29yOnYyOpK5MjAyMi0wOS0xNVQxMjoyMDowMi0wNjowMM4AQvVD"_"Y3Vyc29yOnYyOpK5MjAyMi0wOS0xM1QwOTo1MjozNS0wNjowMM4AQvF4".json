          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI am simulating a coupled reaction-diffusion system that results in temperature spikes. I am interested in tracking the maximum temperature for the entire domain over the course of the simulation in order to generate a maximum temperature contour. I am currently doing this by generating output files, reading them in Paraview, saving the results as csv files, and then using a postprocessing script in MATLAB to generate the contour as showed below.\n\nHowever, this is quite time consuming and I was wondering if it is possible to use Postprocessors to keep track of the maximum temperature over all time steps. I tried to use a combination of the 'NodalExtremeValue' and 'TimeExtremeValue' postprocessors, but that simply outputs a scalar corresponding to the node with the highest temperature for each time step.\nCan I please get some advice?\nThanks in advance.",

The problem that I faced is essentially due to large timestep value that I took and that is why the convergence issues were coming.

One triangular waveform cycle require 80 lines in the file at a timestep of 1. If I make timestep smaller, eg. 0.05, it will require 1600 lines, and if I need to run a simulation for 50 cycles, I will have to repeat these lines for 80000 times.\nOne solution I am thinking is I will write a script file that can copy the data repeatedly for me. If there is a better way, please suggest.\nThanks and Regards",

Is there any helpful source on how to connect external code for specific calculations to MOOSE? Many thanks in advance.",

          "bodyText": "Howdy,\nI am reading a code as follows. My question is In the Material, why  eos_uo(getUserObject<EOS1P>(\"eos_uo\")) but not  eos_uo(getUserObject<EOS1P_IdealFluid>(\"eos_uo\"))? Is there any documentation related to this I can find in moose website?\nI heard from others that the reason is that EOS1P_IdealFluid inherits from EOS1P, so if the parent object name is used, all the children objects can be used. We can also use the the child object name but only that child object can be used. Is this how it works in moose? Thank you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput File:\n[UserObjects]\n  [./eos]\n    type = **EOS1P_IdealFluid**\n    bulk_modulus = 2e+012\n  [../]\n[]\n[Materials]\n  [./area0]\n    type = FluidWell_1p1c\n    eos_uo = eos\n  [../]\n[]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaterial:\nFluidWell_1p1c::FluidWell_1p1c(const InputParameters & parameters)\n  : FluidWellGeneral(parameters),\n    eos_uo(getUserObject<**EOS1P**>(\"eos_uo\")),\n{\n}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUserObject:\n**EOS1P_IdealFluid**::EOS1P_IdealFluid(const InputParameters & parameters)\n  : EOS1P(parameters),\n{\n}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------",
