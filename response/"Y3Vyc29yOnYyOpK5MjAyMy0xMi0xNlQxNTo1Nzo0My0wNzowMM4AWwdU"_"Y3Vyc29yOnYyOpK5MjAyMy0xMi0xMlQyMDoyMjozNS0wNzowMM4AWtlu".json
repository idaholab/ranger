          "bodyText": "Hi,\nThe problem that i was considering earlier (#19997) has now been stragetised to be implemented under a surrogate scheme in order to better manage the computational performance of the application we are developing for analyzing material problems in the crystal plasticity scale. The training data for the surrogates is planned to be derived from DAMASK homogenization modules, that comprises of the material deformation gradient and the corresponding homogenized stresses. The moose surrogate model then reads the macro deformation gradients from the component model and returns the stresses to their material quadrature points. The plan looks quite feasible give the features available in moose, but may need some tweaks to get in to correct form needed for the implementing the entire workflow. I would need the following to be answered to be able to start working on this proposed model set-up.\n\nI am not quite clear on the format of the training data that i should be writing out from my damask full model that contains deformation gradients and stresses. Looking at the existing code ('NearestPointSurrogate.C'), i see that we might need some features for reading this training data file (*.rd), as currently they can only take in-built data coming from the sampler objects. I welcome any suggestions here, not to forget the format for the training dataset.\nThe other important thing to be answered here is the communication between the component model QP's and the surrogate model. The surrogates are really quick and so it would be more compelling to go for a moose multiapp way of implementation, where the existing 'QuadraturePointMultiapp' (#21340) can be exploited here to handle the surrogate reference from and to the component model. Not quite sure if this is the correct way to address this coupling, but welcome better ideas/suggestions.\n\nThe workflow can be visualized here for your reference.\n\nKind regards,\nArun",

This is, by default:\n~/.local/share/moose/site\n\nSo, you could build the site and then look at it later by opening the index.html file in that location using your web browser. On a Mac, this is as easy as navigating to the location and then typing open index.html in a Terminal to open your default browser. The opened site is fully navigable.\nIf you want to \"install\" those files to a particular location, we have a flag for that. Build MooseDocs by doing the following:\n./moosedocs.py build --destination /my/wonderful/moose/local/website\n\nOf course, you should replace /my/wonderful/moose/local/website with the location on your drive where you want to place the files.",

This happens often with two sub-apps using the same file_base.\nBut looks like this is not that. I m running out of ideas.\n@roystgnr  any idea on why nodeset writing could fail? This is a MOOSE mesh being output.\nIf not, then we would be down for the full input so we can see the problem for ourselves",

So the mass fraction won't change unless it is a nonlinear variable, or if it is computed in some other object (for example, the brine-CO2 stuff computes the mass fractions of water and CO2 in both phases depending on the conditions).",

It seems PorousFlow requires primary species concentration to be very small (preferably a minimum of 1 [units]). Correct?\nI expected my primary concentrations to be about 6 [units], which my dissolution rate correctly gave me. As a result, the water mass fraction becomes exceedingly negative (since \\chi^{water}=1-\\chi^{all_components}. Is there a way I can normalize my primary concentration, hence the mass fraction, so that I obtain a positive water mass fraction?\nAlso, if I\u2019m using mass fraction as a non-linear variable for PorousFlow chemistry, how does Porousflow compute the mass fraction\u2019s evolution? The answer to this question will help me know how Porousflow is computing my primary concentrations. Does it depend on the reaction rate? Thanks.",

As in FEM, we calculate the tangent stiffness matrix (K_T) which consists of two terms K_geometric (function of stress) and K_material(function of material constants) and internal force(function of stress). This stress tensor (input from outside) will evaluate the tangent stiffness matrix and internal force at every iteration.\nI want to define a new material that will take deformation tensor (F) as input from Moose and give stress tensor (S) as output back to MOOSE which will be used for the evaluation of stiffness, the code for this calculation from F to S is based on small scale and I already coded on C++ framework\nI am struggling to do that",
