For example:\n[rho_out]\n    type = ADFunctorElementalAux\n    functor = 'rho_gas'\n    variable = 'rho_var'\n    execute_on = 'timestep_end'\n  []\n\nHowever, both in a VPP and in the Exodus file, the values of rho_var correspond to that for the last element in my mesh.  Values for the other elements don't show up.  Is there some way to do this?\nThanks,\nJoe Kelly",

My suspicion is that you are creating a nodal aux variable, in which case you will be evaluating a nodal aux kernel ... and we use _current_elem in the FunctorElementalAux evaluation which will be wrong if the aux kernel is being evaluated as a nodal quantity. We will add an error check to FunctorElementalAux that will catch this in the future",

If the PDE isn't too horrible, it would work and you get the added bonus of having one less variable and significantly less dof when you scale.",

          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nI recently started using MOOSE to do some elastic deformation. I would like to prescribe a short (in time) and localized (in space) change in the Dirichlet boundary condition on one of the sides of my domain. I used inline functions before to add temporal and spatial constraints to constant boundary conditions. A generic example:\n[BCs]\n  [BC_1]\n     type = FunctionDirichletBC\n      variable = my_variable\n      boundary = 'my_boundary'\n      function = 'if( (x>1.) & (x<2.) & (t>1.), 1., 0.)'\n  []\n[]\n\nBut now I have a forcing with values through time stored in a file that I load with a function:\n[Functions]\n  [forcing]\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    data_file = my_forcing.csv\n    scale_factor = 1.0\n    format = 'columns'\n  []\n[]\n\nAnd would like to apply it when specific spatial conditions are met. I initially thought the following could maybe be possible in BC_1:\nfunction = 'if( (x>1.) & (x<2.), forcing, 0) or function = 'if( (x>1.) & (x<2.), forcing(t), 0) but this is not the case.\nAll the input files are very useful and helped me a lot to setup my app but in this case I am struggling a bit to find the right strategy.\nMaybe the/a proper way to do it would be to, at the mesh generation step, give a different  blockID to the elements where I want to prescribe this forcing and then use block ids in the input file?\nAny help would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot in advance!\nP.S. I've been enjoying MOOSE a lot so far, being a Libmesh user this is making everything much easier and more efficient!
