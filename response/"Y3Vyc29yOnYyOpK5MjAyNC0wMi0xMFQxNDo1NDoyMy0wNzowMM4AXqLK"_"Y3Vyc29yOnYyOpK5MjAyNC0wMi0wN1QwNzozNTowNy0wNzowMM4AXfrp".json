          "bodyText": "Hi,\nThis is a general question regarding mooseframework. Not a bug or an issue.\nThe problem that I am working on needs to develop an InterfaceKernel for ArrayVariable, because the model has many solution variables. Those variables can be grouped in few of the ArrayVariables.\nDuring implementation I observed that,\nIn most of the base classes (KernelBase.h, DGKernelBase.h, NodalBCBase.h ) resudual and jacobian related functions at QP (e.g., computeQpResidual, computeQpJacobian, computeQpOffDiagJacobian) are not declared in their corresponding base classes. Rather they are declared in the next level of derived classes (Kernel.h. ArrayKernel.h,    DGKernel.h, ArrayDGKernel.h  etc). This is good because those classes need to inherit common stuff(element, neighbor, QP etc) from their base class([kernel, Arraykernel]<= KernelBase, [DGKernel, ArrayDGKernel]<=DGKernelBase etc.). And computeQpResidual, computeQpJacobian, computeQpOffDiagJacobian can have different return types based on the variable type(real, array) they are operating on.\nOne exception is in the InterfaceKernelBase.h. Where computeQpJacobian, computeQpOffDiagJacobian are declared in the base class itself, with a return type 'Real'. I was wondering if there is any reason for doing that?\nBecause, when I write the class ArrayInterfaceKernel.h derived from  InterfaceKernelBase.h for ArrayVariable, return type mismatch for computeQpJacobian and computeQpOffDiagJacobian prohibits to inherit(and override) those two functions from that base class.\n\n  \n    \n      moose/framework/include/interfacekernels/InterfaceKernelBase.h\n    \n    \n        Lines 46 to 54\n      in\n      27c9045\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           protected: \n        \n\n        \n          \n             /// Compute jacobians at quadrature points \n        \n\n        \n          \n             virtual Real computeQpJacobian(Moose::DGJacobianType /*type*/) { return 0; } \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n        \n\n        \n          \n             /// compute off-diagonal jacobian components at quadrature points \n        \n\n        \n          \n             virtual Real computeQpOffDiagJacobian(Moose::DGJacobianType /*type*/, unsigned int /*jvar*/) \n        \n\n        \n          \n             { \n        \n\n        \n          \n               return 0; \n        \n\n        \n          \n             } \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nBest\nSubhendu Chakraborty\nLos Alamos National Laboratory",

The outlet boundary condition was constant pressure = 0.\nI came across this thread when looking for a solution: #21418\nHowever, I am having trouble understanding the difference between the 'no flux' and 'no penetration' cases described here, as well where the mentioned approaches are implemented (ie - can this be done through a moose input file, or would custom BCs be required?)\nMy question then, is: Have I misunderstood the relationship between Neumann BCs and the no penetration condition, and what is the proper way to implement the free slip condition for inviscid flows in FE, rather than FV?\nThanks!",

Previously I was visualising mass flux, hence my misunderstanding.\nIs INSADMomentumNoBCBC still appropriate to impose the above condition?\n(As a side note if so, is there a convenient way to pass in components of my velocity variable, since the BC does not accept vectors?

However, I do think there will be one incoming with #22671\n@GiudGiud the NoBCBC just weakly adds the stresses on the boundaries, so it's basically setting: stress = stress ... so it's doing nothing. Practically speaking it imposes some condition on some higher derivative. Here's what's in our documentation:\n\nThe INSADMomentumNoBCBC class is used to implement the \"No Boundary Condition\" developed by Griffiths. According to Griffiths, the \"No Boundary Condition\" is equivalent to imposing the condition on the original analytical problem that the (p+1)st derivative of a finite element variable of order p should vanish at a point close to the outflow. This is claimed to reduce error relative to a natural boundary condition.",

The main requirement is to be able to compute the traction on the surface (see this line  in GolemFaultShearStress.C) as the product between the stress tensor and the unit normal vector to the surface.",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI am working on thermo-hydro-mechanical geothermal reservoir simulation, I want to model the response of a fault against water injection. To model the 2D fault i have to option 1) defining fault as a physical entity using Gmsh along with \"lower_dimensional_block\" and 2) defining fault as a lower dimensional block using MOOSE options (i.e.  SideSetsBetweenSubdomainsGenerator and LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator). So, the input file for both is the same only mesh block changes.\nthe model has 15-15-6 km dimension in x,y and z direction and the fault located at the center. Accoring to the manual of \"EquelValueConstraint\" LINK , I defined two sidessets on the boundaries of the subdomains at two sides of the fault as follows:\n[Mesh]\n  [./file]\n    type = FileMeshGenerator\n    file = tpv104-inbox-fault.msh\n  [../]\n  [./sidesetmid1]\n    type = SideSetsBetweenSubdomainsGenerator\n    input = 'file'\n    primary_block = 'SDMidBack'\n    paired_block = 'SDMidFront'\n    new_boundary = 'primary1_interface'\n  [../]\n  [./sidesetmid2]\n    type = SideSetsBetweenSubdomainsGenerator\n    input = 'sidesetmid1'\n    primary_block = 'SDMidFront'\n    paired_block = 'SDMidBack'\n    new_boundary = 'primary2_interface'\n  [../]\n  [interfacemid]\n    type = LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator\n    input = sidesetmid2\n    sidesets = 'primary2_interface'\n    new_block_id = '10000'\n    new_block_name = 'interfacemid'\n    []\n    []\n\nHere is the model (figure 1):\n\nWhen I am using the first technique (adding \"lower_dimensional_block\" phrase in .msh mesh file), everything is fine and the outputs make sense.\nHowever, I have to use second technique as I need to have \"EqualValueConstraint\" in my simulation meaning that I have to have sidesets and LDBlock in the mesh. So, I defined then as above. At this step, I only defined gravity in the model. But the stress distribution along depth seems wrong. in the following, more detials are given:\nAccording to Mechanics, I tried to set gravity and I applied it using two methods available in Porous Flow including : Gravity Kernel and Action. I drew a line crossing the center of the model from top to bottom to check gravity distribution over depth. But at the bottom of the fault I have got strange jump in gravity (figure below, figure 2) at two scenarios, kernel and action:\n\nAlso, as you can see, displacement seems strange as well, i.e. lower dimensional block OR sidesets behave like sink where the magnitude differs alot w.r.t. around.\nJust to make a comparisson, i plotted the distribution at a point far away from the lower dimensional block and sidesets. It is a bit shocking, since the jump disappears. Also, comparing this figure with the figure above (figure 2), it can be see that the gravity magnitude changes at the top alot. in this figure, the magnitude starts from about zero which makes sense BUT in the figure above it starts from positive and drops suddenly to negative magnitude.\n\nTo delve more into the issue, i clipped the model at the center where fault exsits to see the distribution. It is obvious that the magnitude along the fault changes alot (and does not make sense).\n\nI can not understand what is happening once lower dimensional block OR sidesets are working with 3D elements. How can i solve this issue?\nBTW, I got the almsot same result for the gravity distribution when I set hydrostatic stress state in the model, Sxx=Syy=Szz.\nThank you in advance",

The governing equations comprise 2 pdes and describe mass balance between adsorption/desorption between an external gas volume and the surface layer, and diffusion between the surface layer and the bulk concentration, and then onward diffusion downstream in the bulk only.\nI was wondering what the best way to implement this scenario in moose would be? since I can't see anything that can act as a boundary restricted variable and, ideally, I'd prefer not to use an additional layer of cells for all external surfaces of any mesh trying to implement this surface model; spatially, the thickness of this layer would be one atom thick compared to mm or m thickness of the bulk material.
