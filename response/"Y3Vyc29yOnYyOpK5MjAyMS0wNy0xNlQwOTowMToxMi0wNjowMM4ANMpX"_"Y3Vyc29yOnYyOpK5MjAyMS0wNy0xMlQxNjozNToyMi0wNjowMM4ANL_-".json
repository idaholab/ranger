          },
          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm canvassing ideas on how to simulate thermal contraction in fractured systems using MultiApps.  This extending some work I've been doing with @rpodgorney , @lynnmunday , @cbolisetti and KT on solving non-isothermal flow through fractured porous media.  My question takes a few pictures to understand....\nImagine a solid material (the \"matrix\") that contains a thin plate-like void (the \"fracture\").  Let's just think of the 2D case, where the matrix is a 2D square and the fracture is a 1D line segment:\n\n(fracture is the red line)\nImagine injecting cold fluid into the fracture.  After some time, the cold will diffuse a little way into the matrix.  This cold \"sheath\" around the fracture will thermally contract, leading to an increase in the fracture aperture:\n\nIn the work I've been doing, I've been using a MultiApp approach: one App models the fracture physics and one App models the matrix physics.  One big reason for doing this is that realistic fractures are actually complicated networks that are difficult to mesh, and extremely difficult to mesh as part of a 3D solid system, so keeping the fracture mesh separate from the solid mesh is very advantageous.  Another advantage is computational speed, since the fracture physics is often quite complicated (not just heat flow, even though that's what I'm concentrating on in this Discussion).  In this approach, heat energy from the fracture App appears in the matrix App as a set of Dirac sinks/sources.\n\n(matrix elements are shown as squares, fracture Dirac sinks/sources are red dots)\nMy end game is to accurately predict fracture aperture as a function of temperature in the system.\nHowever, a straightforward thermal contraction in the matrix is exactly the opposite of what I want to see: the cold elements contract, pulling the remaining elements towards them.  This is because the matrix mesh does not contain an explicit fracture:\n\n(matrix elements have contracted due to cold Dirac sources)\nSo, how can I accurately predict fracture aperture using this MultiApp approach?\nI can think of a few not-so-good ways of doing this (using an analytic solution, cutting matrix elements, empirical approach).  Can you think of some potential ways forward?  I'm not asking for \"the one-and-only answer\" (although that'd be great, heheheh) - I'm just hoping someone might initiate a good approach.",

The symmetry condition is simply u_x = 0 on the symmetry plane. Now, to represent a discontinuity, just don't prescribe Dirichlet BC on the part of the symmetry plane that overlaps with the fracture -- leave it stress-free. If other physics are modeled correctly, I expect to see crack opening.",

Unfortunately, the situation is more complicated than the above pictures: there are many elliptical fracture planes intersecting each other all over the place.  I just drew the simple situation to make the problem clearer.  Yes, also we have fluid in the fracture and in the matrix, and those physics are governed by PorousFlow, and geomechanics too, but all those things can be handled easily enough.  The thermal contraction and its impact on the fracture aperture is the difficult bit.  (The same problematic phenomenon also occurs for mechanical deformation from fluid pressure, but i thought thermal contraction/expansion was easier to explain.)",

It can handle hydraulic fracture in porous media, with Darcy flow, stokes flow, etc. There are plenty of literature on this subject. Several papers by Mary Wheeler, Chad Landis, and Blaise Bourdin would be a good starting point. But it seems that the commitments so far prevent you from choosing a completely different method.",

In this case E_{ijxx}=0, or more generally E_{ijmn}P_{mk}{P_{nl}, where P_{mk}=delta_{mk}-n_{m}n_{k}, is the projection operator and n is the normal to the fracture plane.  (Also could use Cosserat with fracture normal stiffness = 0, and suitable fracture shear stiffness.)  This will mean that any heat load will cause zero stress_{xx}, so the element won't contract along the x direction.  As the cool temperature hits the next layer of matrix elements, they will contract, pulling the fracture-containing elements with them, leading to the correct result.  This approach is only spatially accurate to the size of one matrix element, but that's exactly the accuracy we get using the MultiApp approach anyway.",

Obviously if the fracture had zero shear strength, 2 of these would be correct (E_ijkx = 0 = E_xjkl), but the other 2 follow only by symmetry of E and are not necessarily physically correct.\nCosserat mechanics gets around this by having non-symmetric stress, strain and E, so can have E_xjkl = 0 but E_ixkl != 0.   But the disadvantage is a considerable increase in compute intensity for little gain: Cosserat is actually only needed in the few matrix elements that contain fractures, and an estimate of fracture shear strength is needed, and Cosserat is only true in the small layer-thickness limit anyway.\nSo I can't see any clear right or wrong in selecting E_ijkx = E_ijxl = E_xjkl = E_ixkl = 0.  (Or more generally E_mnop P_{mi}P_{nj}P_{ok}P_{pl}.)  My intuition tells me it is better to use these because I want to treat these matrix elements like very flexible material.",

I would like to ask you some questions, and I wish you can give me some guidance or advice, even though these questions seem simple to you. I have recently worked to develop a program on mobility anisotropy. I'm going to use the C-H equation. I introduced an anisotropic function about the angle in mobility and defined a corresponding subroutine in the ''Material' module. Next, I defined a subroutine in the kernel that introduced anisotropic functions modeled after \"SplitCHWResBase\". But I met some problems, as follows:\n\u2460Do I also need to copy \"SplitCHParsed\" to create a new subroutine?\n\u2461How to solve the \"Signal 11\" problem? (I have tried to check the problem according to Q&A, but failed)\n\u2462How do I know if a subroutine module I've written is successful?\n\uff08I enclose the associated subroutine defined below\uff09\nANisotropicFirst_C.txt\nANisotropicFirst_h.txt\nSplitCHWResBase2.txt",

I looked at the sink documentation, but I couldn't find something that fit what I need.\nThanks in advance!\nMatias",

I was wondering if I could use an existing exidus output file to pull the required variable into my main app, to take out the requirement of the sub app. Maybe the restart and recovery system can help me do this? I know i can just apply functions as my AuxVariables used for coupling, but I thought it might add some robustness to testing if i used an existing output file. I am not fully aware how variable transfer happens under the hood, so my idea about how to do this might not add anything to testing.\nIf anyone has ideas on how to do testing with MultiApps, I am all ears.\nThanks,\nZack",

          "bodyText": "I am trying to create periodic boundary conditions on the displacement field and constrain one of the corner nodes to have zero displacement (to get rid of rigid body translations). I was able to do this in an older version of MOOSE (before mesh generators), but now I get an error\n\"Your MeshGenerator tree contains multiple possible generator outputs :\n\"sidesets and one or more of the following from an independent set: \"ns1\"\nThis may be due to a missing dependency or may be intentional. Please select the final MeshGenerator in\nthe [Mesh] block with the \"final_generator\" parameter or add additional dependencies to remove the ambiguity.\"\nThe way that I created the boundary side sets is using the SideSetsFromNormalsGenerator and to create the corner node I use ExtraNodesetGenerator with coord='0 0 0'. I think this error is referring to the fact that the side sets contain the extra node set that I am creating. For some reason, this wasn't a problem in the older code (I think the Dirichlet BC had precedence over the periodic BC's) but it is now.\nIs there another way to implement these BC's?",
