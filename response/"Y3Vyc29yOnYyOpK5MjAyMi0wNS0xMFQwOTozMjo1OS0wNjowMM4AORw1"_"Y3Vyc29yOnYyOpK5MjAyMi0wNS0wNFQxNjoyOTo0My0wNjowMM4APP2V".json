Looking through the LibMesh documentation I only found a numbering for the nodes but not for the qps. Does that mean every element in MOOSE is fully integrated? Is there a way to manually switch to reduced integration?\nI'm aware there is the volumetric_locking_correction feature but to my understanding that is not same thing. Or am I wrong here?",

You may get away with underintegrating in some multiphysics problems potentially, but I'd assume this will need to be assessed case by case. The particular modes of deformation of an element typically have a larger importance in mechanics problems with plasticity, e.g, compared to other physics.\nI think the original question goes back to the fact that, to ensure correctness and optimal computational effort in solid mechanics finite element problems, reduced integration is typically used for higher order elements (for first order, we'd need hourglass controls, which we don't have yet). If you want to use higher order elements, I'd be hesitant to use the volumetric locking correction (maybe Gary has studied this more and can comment). Maybe it's worth playing with reduced integration with your problem. Based on Guillaume's description of libmesh's quadrature option, selecting THIRD and the blocks you want your quadrature to apply to will do the trick.",

Note that  depends on .\nI think that I have managed to implement the computation of the stress through a Material following ComputeSurfaceTensionKKS, here is the relevant code:\nvoid\nADCapillaryStress::computeQpProperties()\n{\n  auto & S = _capillary_stress[_qp];\n  S.zero();\n\n  const ADReal nx = _grad_v[_qp](0);\n  const ADReal ny = _grad_v[_qp](1);\n  const ADReal nz = _grad_v[_qp](2);\n\n  S(0, 0) += _kappa[_qp] * nx * nx;\n  S(0, 1) += _kappa[_qp] * nx * ny;\n  S(1, 1) += _kappa[_qp] * ny * ny;\n  S(0, 2) += _kappa[_qp] * nx * nz;\n  S(1, 2) += _kappa[_qp] * ny * nz;\n  S(2, 2) += _kappa[_qp] * nz * nz;\n\n  // fill in symmetrically\n  S(1, 0) = S(0, 1);\n  S(2, 0) = S(0, 2);\n  S(2, 1) = S(1, 2);\n}\n\nNow if the divergence of the stress were a gradient, this would be the usual diffusion equation, using _grad_u:\nADReal\nADAnisotropicDiffusion::computeQpResidual()\n{\n  return _lambda[_qp] * _grad_u[_qp] * _grad_test[_i][_qp];\n}\n\nBut here instead of _grad_u, in my weak form, I have divergence of the stress. I have noticed grad.row of potential relevance in InitialConditionTempl.C, but not sure at all. Taking inspiration from ADStressDivergenceTensors, maybe something like that (probably wrong though):\nADReal\nADAnisotropicDiffusion::computeQpResidual()\n{\n  return _lambda[_qp] * _stress[_qp].grad.row(_component) * _grad_test[_i][_qp];\n}\n\nThe other possibility would be to deport the two derivatives onto the test function, but I would rather avoid using higher order elements.\nThanks",

Which one is that? What is the object name?\n\n\nThe problem is my linear momentum equation is coupled with phase-filed variable which is also an AD quantity. As far as I understood, when I have a AD kernel with all AD material properties, it is impossbile to use a non-AD material in between with a Newton solver that im using.\n\nIt is not impossible. It is just that using regular properties will miss some derivatives, so the Jacobian in the Newton method will not be numerically perfect.\n\nfortunately you mentioned that I can still use a non-AD material and get it to work. I tried to change the material property to a non AD for the ice stress but for some reason crystal plasticity is not accepting the deformation gradients from the ComputeFiniteStrain (I asked this question in another thread). I dont think I can use the tensor mechaincs master class action since it just adds an stress divergence but my stress is multiplied by a phasefield variable which makes it impossible to use master class.\n\nOk makes sense why you cannot use the action.\n\nAlso I've tried to use the materialADConverter, but it gives me error that this object is not a registered object?? not sure what is this....\n\ncan you paste it here?

I would assume the last solution is to write an AD material property for it but I really have no idea how to start the whole code is very overwhelming and hard to digest for me since i'm both new to framework and C++ .
