Is it possible to use the Constraints System (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Constraints/index.html) for that? Or how would I enforce such a constraint?\nI have also seen the Global Strain System, but I am not too sure how to use it...\nThanks for your help.",

You can find the source code here:\nEqualValuePlusConstant.h\nEqualValuePlusConstant.C\nTo use EqualValuePlusConstant (lack of a better name), just copy and paste these files into your own MOOSE app and be sure to change registerMooseObject(\"YourAppName\", EqualValuePlusConstant); to reflect \"YourAppName\" in the .C file.\nThe object works pretty well, but proceed at your own risk. I didn't put very much effort into writing the code - just wanted to demonstrate how you, yourself, could begin to solve your problem with MOOSE. I'm not sure what sort of physics you are working with, but I created two fairly simple tests: one that solves a diffusion problem and another that solves a solid mechanics problem.\n\n\nThe diffusion problem: tairoon1_diffusion_constraint.i, models a square domain with a scalar field, u, such that u = 0 on the left and u = 1 on the right by enforcing u_left = 0 and the constraint R = u_left - u_right + 1.\n\n\nThe mechanics problem: tairoon1_mechanical_constraint.i, models a 12\" x 12\" x 12\" steel cube that is fixed at the bottom. A displacement of 0.5\" is applied in the x-direction to the nodes along the top left side of the cube, and one of 0.6\" to the nodes along the top right side, by enforcing u_left = 0.5 and the constraint R = u_left - u_right + 0.1.\n\n\nYou can basically use my code as a template and create a more formal MooseObject for this simple multi-freedom constraint problem. Perhaps you even consider developing it in the Framework and opening a pull request :)",

There are plenty demonstrations of how this works on the repository.\nI used a penalty formulation because that\u2019s what I am most familiar with. I actually don\u2019t really know how Lagrange multipliers work exactly, but I know there are examples of them in MOOSE.

Some problems that I noticed so far are: it only ever seems to converge using PJFNK and not at all using Newton. Also there seems to be some problems whenever there are many constraints.\nCould you please take a look at my code? There are the constraint files .h .C, and a mesh + input file. The example I am trying to compute is a simple shear of a unit cell with a stiff fiber inside. A displacement in x direction is applied on the top surface using constraints [topedge_x, topedge_y], while the right and left edge are constrained to be equal. However, the right and left edges behave overly stiff and the simulation does not look right. When I remove the constraints [rightedge_x, rightedge_y], the simulation result looks fine.\nThank you!",

Basically, what I'd like to do in syncSolutions is something like this:\nneks_multi_app = somehowGetMultiappInMasterFile();\n\nif (!neks_multi_app->firstStep() && !nekrs_multi_app->interpolateTransfers())\n  return;\n\nwhere I would add those functions to TransientMultiApp, such as:\nbool TransientMultiApp::firstStep() { return _first; }\n\nMy master app input file looks like\n[MultiApps]\n  [nek]\n    type = TransientMultiApp\n    app_type = NekApp\n    input_files = 'nek.i'\n    interpolate_transfers = false # how to get this in NekApp?\n  []\n[]\n\nIs it possible to access the TransientMultiApp from within NekProblem?

If the section that you are executing has not been called yet before TIMESTEP_END, it doesn't exist it'll error out that it can't find the section.\nFor the time being, your solution is to set execute_on to something on your own that occurs after the section has been called, which in your case is almost anything but TIMESTEP_END. Something like NONLINEAR or FINAL.\nThis isn't a very friendly error. We actually register the section very early on (well before INITIAL), therefore we do know that it exists.

Suppose I run nekRs with a smaller dt than a master app, and I have a transfer of heat flux to nekRS on timestep_end. If I'm subcycling nekRS, is that heat flux field fixed for each of the smaller steps taken by nekRS?\n\n\nIf it is, isn't it extra work to keep calling syncSolutions() for each nekRS dt? In this function, I'm writing into nekRS arrays and doing a problem-wide normalization to conserve power, which requires some global communication in nekRS.\n\n\nIf it isn't, what is going on under the hood here?\n\n\nThanks!\n-April",

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI have been using MOOSE to compute some mechanics problems. I implemented a Neo-Hookean material model by defining a new strain function which sets the deformation gradient as the total strain, and a stress function which computes the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress for a Neo-Hookean solid. The stiffness is derived using Automatic Differentiation. The files can be found here.\nNow, for small deformations, this yields good results and I can also observe a quadratic convergence of the Newton solver. But I noticed for a specific problem, that sometimes the Newton solver would converge, but the end result would contain flipped elements\n. This example contains a uniaxial compression in the x direction of a square. The input and mesh file leading to this final deformation are also given in the link above. Using a smaller timestep size seems to prevent this problem from happening. However, I am confused, whether something with my code is wrong or what is going on?\nI also used another FE solver and compared it with the MOOSE results. For \"easy\" simulations, both results are exactly the same, the residuals in each Newton iteration are exactly the same, but for more complicated case, MOOSE converges a lot slower... When I take a very small timestep in MOOSE dt=0.01 (element does not flip over), the same result is obtained as my other solver, which only needs a single time step dt=1. I also tried to not use Automatic Differentiation and directly code the consistent stiffness, however, it also lead to the same suboptimal convergence.\nOne difference in both solvers that I noticed is that MOOSE seems to use some line search algorithm that prevents the residual from increasing. In my other solver, that is not the case and always a full Jacobian step is used. Is there any way to deactivate the line search in MOOSE?\nCan anyone help me with this? I am really confused and honestly frustrated that MOOSE sometimes flips over my elements without any indicator or warnings...\nThanks.",
