          "bodyText": "Dear Community,\nFollowing the procedure recommended here, I would like to propose a \"BlockSubdomainModifier\" for discussion.\nMotivation and current situation\nWith the group of \"XYZSubdomainModifiers\" Moose provides a tool to re-assign elements to different subdomains (blocks) during an simulation run. In tensor mechanis, this approach might be used to model the removal/excavation and refill. For geometrical complex models, the most efficient way defining the volumes to be excavated/refilled might be defined by means of subdomains. This leads to the task of moving whole blocks from one subdomain to another at pre-known points in time in a Moose-model. For this purpose the use of a CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier is shown in #26941.\nAs shown in #26941, to just move one block once to another subdomain a Moose input file needs at least an AuxVariable, an FunctionAux, and a CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier. Na\u00efvely one could argue, it takes 36 lines of code to reassign a single block once to another subdomain - which is a source of error on its own. In geotechnical or mining applications it is necessary to reassign several blocks during one simulation.\nProposed BlockSubdomainModifier\nTo ease re-assignment, make Moose input files shorter, and reduce potential sources of error I'd like to propose an BlockSubdomainModifier. The BlockSubdomainModifier inherits from ElementSubdomainModifier (and therefore inheriting also the handling of the boundaries). The new UserObject takes a path to a CSV formates file containing the information on when to move which block where. Therefore, only one UserObject will be needed for all block reassignments in a given model.\nSnipped of the input file using the proposed BlockSubdomainModifier:\n[UserObjects]\n  [BlockSubdomainModifier1]\n    type = BlockSubdomainModifier\n    file_name = 'stages-tab.csv'\n    header = 'ON'\n    execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_BEGIN'\n  []\n[]\n\nThe corresponding CSV-File may contain a header and 3 columns (time, source-subdomain, and destination-subdomain):\ntime,   BlockFrom,  BlockTo\n0.40,   Box1,       8\n0.20,   Box2,       8\n0.60,   8,          Box1\n\nAs can be seen in the CSV above, also subdomain-names are permissible (to improve readability and debugging). To allow for this, this proposal also includes the implementation of the DelimitedFileReaderOfString which is copied from the DelimitedFileReader (and removed all the stuff connected to conversion to double).\nImpact to existing Moose apps\nAs this proposal only adds functionality and does not change any existing code, existing Moose apps should be able to cope with the proposed changes without any problems.\nI would be delighted if you could consider this proposal.\nEdit Please find the code here including:\n\nBlockSubdomainModifier.C\nDelimitedFileReaderOfString.C",

A block is the same as a subdomain so a BlockSubdomainModifier is not something that is easily understandable.\nGiven the design I would say: TimedSubdomainModifier.\nThis conveys well that there are no other decision criteria on when to change the mesh. Also since there's \"Element\" in the name, it s understood that entire subdomains will change at once.\nI can see simple input parameters as an alternative to the CSV file for simple problems. And for your large problem, use the CSV file option.\nGuillaume",

So, instead of a concrete TimedSubdomainModifier, I suggest you create an intermediate abstract class called TimedElementSubdomainModifier, which doesn't perform the actual job. Add an additional input parameter times or target_times in TimedElementSubdomainModifier. All the logic related to target times should go into this intermediate class. For example, we should allow users to specify the target times with a vector, i.e. target_times = '0.2 0.4 0.6'. Once you have this intermediate class, let the existing ThresholdElementSubdomainModifier inherit from it, so that the new capability you add will also benefit all the existing modifiers.\nThe inheritance diagram I'm imagining (could be improved, for sure) is\n                  ElementSubdomainModifier\n                             |\n                 TimedElementSubdomainModifier\n                        |              |  \nThresholdElementSubdomainModifier    CSVSubdomainModifier\n              |\nCoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier",

          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE experts,\nI'm currently working on transfer adaptive mesh refinement from a main application into a sub-application within a MultiApp. We found that LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer can meet such requirements, but it is located in the level set module instead of the moose module. Based on the provided reference calculation example (parent.i), I wrote my own calculation example file.\nHowever, upon implementing a similar setup in our custom application, we've encountered an issue where the mesh adaptivity does not seem to be executed within the sub-application. Additionally, as shown in the attached image,\n\nthe markers intended for transfer do not appear to be successfully replicated in the sub-app.\nI'm seeking guidance on the following points:\n\nCould there be specific considerations or settings that I might have overlooked in applying LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer to ensure successful mesh refinement and marker transfer to the sub-app?\nIs the Level Set Module's LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer inherently applicable to other apps, or are there strategies to generalize its application for use with other MOOSE-based Apps?\n\nAny insights, suggestions, or references to similar cases would be immensely appreciated. Our goal is to effectively leverage MOOSE's capabilities for our project, and resolving this issue is crucial for our progress.\nThank you in advance for your support and guidance.\nBest regards,\nWei",

                          "bodyText": "Hi Guillaume,\nThank you for your suggestion regarding the timing of marker transfer and adaptivity execution. Following your advice, I attempted to configure the execution of the MultiApp to occur at both timestep_begin and timestep_end to see if it would facilitate the successful transfer of markers into the sub-app. Unfortunately, this adjustment did not lead to the markers being executed within the sub-application as intended.\nFurther investigation into the issue revealed some additional insights. I inserted breakpoints within the LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer code to monitor its execution flow. Through this method, I observed that LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer::initialSetup() is being called and executed as expected. However, LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer::execute(), which is crucial for the actual transfer of adaptivity information, does not seem to be triggered at all. This observation contrasts with the behavior seen in the reference example (parent.i), where LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer::execute() is executed effectively.\nMoreover, I encountered a limitation regarding the execution_on parameter within the LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer. It appears that this parameter is private to LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer and thus cannot be explicitly set in the input file.\nGiven these observations, it seems we are facing a more complex challenge related to the execution mechanism of the LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer. Any further insights or recommendations on how to ensure the execute() method is triggered appropriately would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you once again for your support and for helping to steer the investigation in the right direction.\nBest regards,\nWei",

Below is my reply to your suggestions,\n\nI thought I saw a different post last year transfering a marker with a regular transfer.\n\nYou mean we use a regular method to transfer a marker and then run adaptivity in the sub-app, right? hugary1995 does this by directly transferring the variable used to evaluate the error in ref1 and ref2.\n\nDo you really want an exact synchronization of the two meshes or can they be offset by one time step?\n\nI believe  the correct approach is to initially run the main-app, followed by the transferring the mark information to the sub-app. Subsequently, we should transfer the relevent data to the sub-app, enabling the sub-app's mesh configuration aligns with that of the main-app.\n\nso to execute it, you need to make sure the adaptivity is active in the main app. Maybe force it to run with minimum iteration parameters if that's available?\n\nYeah, I can confirm that the adaptivity mesh is executed at each time step in the main app, but LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer::execute() is not found to be called in the sub-app. Also, in #18813, @aeslaughter said, \"I created LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer 5 years ago for this same concept. There might be a better way to do it now, but if not you can take a look at it for some inspiration.\" Perhaps he can provide more detailed advice.\nIn general, there are two idea. One is to directly transfer variables (e.g. bnds) based on hugary1995's methodl, and other is to use LevelSetMeshRefinementTransfer. I think the latter method is the best method, but there are still some issues to address. This necessitates further guidance for you and aeslaughter.\nWei",

I realize you may have convergence issues because of your 3D heat structure coupling not having full Jacobians. While troubleshooting, can you switch to a 2D cylindrical heat structure. That'll converge nicely. Here's an example:\nmoose/modules/thermal_hydraulics/test/tests/components/heat_transfer_heat_structure_1phase/phy.T_wall_transfer_3eqn_x.i\n\nI suspect this is maybe caused by boundary conditions too close to each other and fighting, plus maybe the equation of state you're using, which I'm not super familiar with.
