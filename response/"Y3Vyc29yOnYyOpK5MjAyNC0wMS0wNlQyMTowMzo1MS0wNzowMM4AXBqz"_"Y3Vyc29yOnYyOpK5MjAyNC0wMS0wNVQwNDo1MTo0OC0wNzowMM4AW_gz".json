          "bodyText": "I'm using a moose environment installed with conda. Recently, I've been attempting to analyze my moose program using gperftools. I followed the instructions in the tutorial at https://mooseframework.inl.gov/application_development/profiling.html, but I'm unsure whether I need to make modifications to libmesh and wasp. My focus is specifically on using gperftools when METHOD=oprof.\n\nlibMesh automatically adds -fno-omit-frame-pointer to METHOD=oprof builds. However, if you want to do profiling with other methods (e.g. opt, which will not give line number information), both libMesh and MOOSE should be built with CXXFLAGS=-fno-omit-frame-pointer. (On a related node, MOOSE will error if the user attempts to compile with either METHOD=devel or METHOD=dbg and with a non-empty GPERF_DIR as those methods add assertions that will make the resulting profiles misleading). When building libMesh, ensure that the METHODS environment variable is either empty (in which case the script will build opt, oprof, devel, and dbg methods), or that METHODS contains oprof (or not if you wish to profile with another method and have specified CXXFLAGS=-fno-omit-frame-pointer).\n\nUpon updating only Petsc, I encountered some errors like this:\n/home/zu/anaconda3/envs/moose-gperf/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/10.4.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /home/zu/ProgramFiles/gperftools/installed/lib/libtcmalloc_and_profiler.so: undefined reference to pthread_key_create@GLIBC_2.34'`\nWhen attempting to update libmesh, I received the following message:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nERROR: LIBMESH_DIR=/home/zu/anaconda3/envs/moose-gperf/libmesh exists within the conda base /home/zu/anaconda3\nExiting in order to stop you from overwriting your conda environment\n\nCan anyone provide guidance on how to successfully integrate gperftools? Thank you in advance for your assistance.",

          "bodyText": "I have developed an SN-DFEM program using MOOSE, and recently, I've been experimenting with the 'LINEAR' solver of the InversePowerMethod executioner. However, I've encountered a peculiar phenomenon: initially, I tested it on a one-dimensional problem with 800,000 degrees of freedom, and according to the system monitor, MOOSE occupied around 700MB of memory. However, when I tested it on a three-dimensional problem with only 80,000 degrees of freedom, the system monitor showed that MOOSE reached a maximum memory usage of around 9.9GB. Conversely, when I used PJFNK to solve the three-dimensional problem, MOOSE only occupied approximately 200MB of memory.\nMy understanding of the LINEAR solver is that it solves a linear problem Ax=b where b=Bx^(n-1)/\u03bb^(n-1) using the krylov method (not JFNK) and requires the complete solution of the entire Jacobian matrix. Storing the Jacobian matrix can indeed be memory-intensive, but the memory usage observed in the tests seems excessively large and unreasonable.\nCould anyone shed light on what might be causing this issue? Additionally, where can I find the code for the LINEAR solver of the InversePowerMethod executioner?\nThank you in advance for any insights.",

In 3D, I used a cuboidal mesh. While I've identified the cause of the memory usage, is it expected for storing the complete Jacobian matrix to require such a significant amount of memory? I noticed the option to set auto_preconditioning=false to disable SMP, but according to MOOSE's description in the Steady executioner, this might lead to incorrect computation results, correct?\n\nLINEAR will use PETSc control parameter -ksp_only to set the type of SNES for solving the linear system. Note that it only works when you have an exact Jacobian because it is not activating matrix-free calculations.\nNEWTON means PETSc will use the Jacobian provided by kernels (typically not exact) to do the Krylov solve. If the Jacobian is not exact, Newton update in Eq. (4) will not reduce the residual effectively and typically results into an unconverged Newton iteration.\n\nI vaguely remember seeing in MOOSE that it's possible to set the off-diagonal level of the Jacobian matrix to determine the range of off-diagonal terms that need to be stored.",

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm encountering a problem using the InversePowerMethod executioner in MOOSE when multiple blocks are involved. The error message I'm encountering is as follows:\nThe following error occurred in the object \"Executioner\", of type \"InversePowerMethod\".\n\n|Bx| = 0!\n\nUpon examining the relevant code, it appears that this error is triggered because the program detects that the _integral_value returned by the ElementIntegralVariablePostprocessor used to calculate |Bx| (Ax=1/lambda*Bx) is 0. Interestingly, this issue doesn't arise in uniform problems, indicating situations where there is only one block.\nTo investigate further, I used show_execution_order = LINEAR to analyze MOOSE's execution order and obtained the following outputs. I'm using an auxkernel named source to calculate Bx values on each element. Subsequently, I use total_source (an ElementIntegralVariablePostprocessor object) to compute the volume integral of the source. Due to the dependency of total_source on source, I specifically added execute_on = 'INITIAL LINEAR' for source. To examine the invocation of total_source, I also configured MOOSE to output this value each time _integral_value is called. In the uniform scenario, it was output twice, whereas in the case of multiple blocks, it was only output once.\nMultiple blocks:\n[DBG] Executing auxiliary kernels on elements on LINEAR\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 1\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 2\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 4\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 3\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 5\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 11\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 12\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 6\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 7\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 8\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 9\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n[DBG] Ordering of AuxKernels on block 10\n[DBG] aux_phi_0 aux_phi_1 aux_phi_2 aux_phi_3 source\n_integral_value = 0\n[DBG] Computing elemental user objects on LINEAR\n[DBG] Execution order of objects types on each element then its sides:\n[DBG] -

            "login": "hityyds"
          },
          "bodyText": "Dear community members,\nI have a question regarding the free power iteration process in the Eigenvalue executioner of MOOSE. Some literature suggests that this process is intended to provide an initial guess for the Newton iteration of the JFNK eigensolver. However, upon reviewing the code in the EigenProblem.C, it appears that the free power iteration also calls JFNK for solving, and this is the same solver used in the subsequent Newton iteration.\nAs per my understanding, in power iteration, the formula for updating eigenvalues is \u03bb^(n) = \u03bb^(n\u22121) |B(x^(n))|/|B(x^(n\u22121))|, but I haven't found any relevant code implementing this. It seems that in power iteration, eigenvalues are also obtained as part of the nonlinear system of equations directly using JFNK just like Newton iteration. The only apparent difference between Newton iteration and free power iteration seems to be the use of the Moose::SlepcSupport::setFreeNonlinearPowerIterations function, which modifies some Petsc parameters specifically for free power iteration. However, does this have any impact on the computation of eigenvalues? I couldn't find documentation for the Petsc parameter -eps_power_update on Google.\nI would appreciate any insights or clarification on how the free power iteration process is implemented in MOOSE.

Maybe if you pass some petsc versbose (ksp_view, snes_view) option we can look at a log and see how the solve goes?\nGuillaume",

However, I still have uncertainties regarding the implementation of free power iteration. For an eigenvalue problem represented as A(x) = 1/\u03bb * B(x), the system of equations that JFNK needs to solve during the Newton iteration is given by: R1(x, \u03bb) = A(x) - 1/\u03bb * B(x) = 0 and R2(x, \u03bb) = \u03bb - |B(x)| = 0. In contrast, during free power iteration, the system of equations that JFNK needs to solve includes only R1(x, \u03bb) = 0 (which, when material properties are constant, forms a linear system of equations). \u03bb is not determined through JFNK; instead, it is iteratively computed between nonlinear iterations as \u03bb^(n) = \u03bb^(n\u22121) * |B(x^(n))| / |B(x^(n\u22121))|. The computational process of free power iteration should be akin to the InversePowerMethod, but the specific calculation step \u03bb^(n) = \u03bb^(n\u22121) * |B(x^(n))| / |B(x^(n\u22121))| seems to be absent in the free power iteration.",

I've recently posed numerous questions, taking up a considerable amount of time from experienced individuals like yourself. I don't want my inquiries to impose too much on your time.\nWhen you mentioned similarity, were you referring to their mathematical forms? I believe the primary distinction between the Newton method and power iteration lies in:\nIn the Newton method, the eigenvalue is also a variable to be solved in JFNK. Although we eliminate the eigenvalue variable lambda by defining R(x) = A(x) - B(x) / |B(x)|, it still influences the Jacobian matrix of the problem: J_newton = (A(x) - B(x) / |B(x)|)'\nHowever, in power iteration, the calculation of the eigenvalue (lambda) is independent of JFNK, resulting in a simpler Jacobian matrix: J_power = (A(x) - B(x) / lambda)', where lambda is a constant for JFNK.\nWe employ power iteration to provide a reasonable initial value for Newton iteration, but ultimately, this initial value is obtained using another Newton method (JFNK). This is the aspect that perplexes me the most.",
