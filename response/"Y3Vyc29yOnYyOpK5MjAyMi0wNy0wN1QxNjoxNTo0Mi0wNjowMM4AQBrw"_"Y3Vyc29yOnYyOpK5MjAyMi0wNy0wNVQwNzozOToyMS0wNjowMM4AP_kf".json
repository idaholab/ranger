What are they major differences between the two? Also, I have a phase-field model with 5 phases. I want to add polycrystal structure to only one of the phases by Voronoi Tessellation. From what I understand, adding the microstructure only adds more phase parameters and interfacial energy. I know how to generate Voronoi Tessellation in the entire domain, but how to do it in only one phase? Thanks.",

          "bodyText": "I have a 2d shell element based model with full symmetry about the x axis, subject to a uniformly distributed pressure load on one edge, x displacement fixed on the other edge and y displacement fixed at the mid point of the edges. This model is fully symmetrical about the x axis. When run however, the results for stress in the 1(y) direction are asymmetric to a substantial degree (See image of contours). Weirdly however, the y displacements seem to be perfectly symmetrical. When I run a mesh that isn't tapered the y stress vanishes as you'd expect, and the X stress becomes uniform, so it seems that the issue is only arising when the mesh is tapered. I would appreciate any insight/advice that could be given on this as I've somewhat reached the end of my troubleshooting abilities in figuring this one out.\nStress 00 (xx) shows symmetry:\n\nDisplacement in x shows symmetry:\n\nAdditionally, the displacement in y also seems to show symmetry:\n\nHowever stress in 01 (xy) and 11 (yy) directions show asymmetry:\n\n\nThe stress values in y are comparable in magnitude to the values in x (160 in yy direction to 1000 in xx) which means this isn't just a numerical error on a value that is vanishingly small.\nThe input file

I was able to replicate it and figure out that the rotation matrix is calculated just once at the start of the simulation and is not stored. Hence, the rotation matrix for the last element was used to transform the stress and strain for all the elements giving incorrect stress and strain distribution. I\nwas able to get the symmetric stress distribution by storing the rotation matrices. Will open a pull request for this.",

You can use the resultant force to each node/edge instead of the pressure.",

Looking at examples, and with experiments of my own, it seems the ADPressure BC doesn't allow the application of loads in the Z direction on a boundary on a 2D X-Y generated mesh. The example (modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/shell/static/beam_bending_moment_AD.i) shows the use of a ConstantRate nodal kernel to apply an out of plane distributed nodal force, however if you don't know the number of nodes on the boundary while writing the input file, it is impossible to correctly define a distributed load this way. As such I was wondering if it is possible to return the number of nodes in a boundary to a function to calculate a force per node equivalent to a certain desired \"total\" force (ie pressure x area)",

I ended up setting up a user object to do just that, it executes in timestep_begin and has a getter function that passes the result without producing new random numbers. I can share the UO for reference here, if it's needed.\nBut I have another question because the documentation on RandomInterface might be throwing me off a bit. it is saying that\n\n...you don't want to be producing new random numbers with each linear iteration as this can impact the convergence of the solver. You can avoid this problem If you \"reset\" the random number generators every \"linear\" iteration...\n\nso that means if I set the setRandomResetFrequency(EXEC_LINEAR) it would keep generating the same number over and over during these linear itterations? what about the next time step? would it generate the same number again? does the seed change after it is being set initially?\nThe reason I am asking this is because I keep getting the same pattern in my run, I will need to look more into it, but even if I use time(NULL) to provide a unique seed other than the default it seems to be almost identical result.\nThanks again for the reply!\nBest,\nKhaled",

I think it ll indeed reset all the time, between linear iterations.\nThe random numbers only depend on the location, the seed and the number of numbers previously generated it seems.\nI think you should modify the seed of the randomData object at each time step if you want to change the pattern between time steps.\nNote that you are getting the same seed between runs on purpose. This really helps debugging to keep the same seed",
