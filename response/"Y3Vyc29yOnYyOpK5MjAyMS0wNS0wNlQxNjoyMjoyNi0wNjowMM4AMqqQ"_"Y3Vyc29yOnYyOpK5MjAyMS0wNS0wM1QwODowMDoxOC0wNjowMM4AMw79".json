All my input files used are attached in the zip file.\n\n  First, I started with a FEM approach (Flow_Past_a_Cylinder_FE_ins.i) which the results looks reasonable.\n\n Since my alternate goal is to model compressible flow, I then tried to run simulations with FVM approach for both incomprehensible and compressible flow.\n\n I used the Mr. Lindsay's (@lindsayad) branch for the compressible flow, the simulation proceed for few timestep but then ran into bad convergence. He did mention the transient feature is not fully supported yet but I'm not sure if the problem is more related to my problem setup.\n\n Then I used Mr. Giudicelli (@GiudGiud) branch for the incompressible flow simulation. I would like to do transient problem but I got this \"Matrix A is singular!\" error even for the steady state case:\n\n\n The input file is adapted from modules\\navier_stokes\\test\\tests\\finite_volume\\pins\\channel-flow\\heated\\2d-rc-heated-boussinesq.i\n\n I wonder what could be wrong with my setup?\n\nFlow_Past_a_Cylinder.zip\nThank you!\nZeyu Chen",

These are used for MMS testing, not for real simulations\nAfter that your simulation converged on my laptop\n\nBest,\nGuillaume",

I'm trying to combine the function_ellipsoid_heat_source model with a voronoi grain growth model. Both of these exist in the MOOSE library and I know they can be linked through use of multiapp, likely with the thermal model being the master and the grain growth as a sub-app. I'm just not sure how to get them to pull from their respective libraries. Do I need to be registering them in the makefile? I didn't want to have to create a separate app, but would that be the best way?\nThank for the help in advance!",

You should consider:\n\nusing a relative non linear tolerance criterion instead of an absolute\nallowing more than 10 non linear iterations so the time steps fail less often\n\nYou could also increase the time step size if that is wise.\nHave you tried the Newton solver? It might work better for your application.\nIn the log I see 28 processes. If your machine has 16 cores it's likely 16 processes will give the best performance.",

It would be nice to have the feature to control whether mooseErrors and mooseWarnings throw independently, either by checking both Moose::_throw_on_error and Moose::_warnings_are_errors inside\nmooseWarningStream or alternatively add an additional flag such as Moose::_throw_on_warning.\nI wouldn't call this an issue, hence I'm putting this in Discussion, but it'd be simple to implement and for me at least it would be a helpful addition for writing certain unit tests.",

Both have an example where nucleation happens throughout the simulation (not just at time 0). In @amjokisaari 's paper, the fitted slope in the Avrami equation is about 2, but in the newer paper, it is about 3. The newer paper says it should be 3 for this case and that it is 2 when nucleation occurs at t=0 and then demonstrates that in an example too. Any idea why there is a discrepancy? Does it have to do with how the timing of the nucleation events is chosen?",
