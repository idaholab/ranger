For this system, supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) was selected as the working fluid. Previously, I had been looking into using established CFD solvers like OpenFOAM or NekRS to solve for the fluid flow, outlet temperature, pressure drop, and surface temperature. Before jumping into these other codes, I wanted to see whether MOOSE's Navier-Stokes module could handle a case like this. I will include more technical specs in the Additional information section below. The biggest issues I foresee are turbulence and compressibility. To be clear: I am not inquiring as to MOOSE's capabilities of modeling radiation, only on the thermal hydraulics.\nTLDR: Can the Navier-Stokes module accurately simulate sCO2 to medium fidelity (or higher) for steady-state operation?\nThank you very much in advance!\nAdditional information\nMesh size and type:\nReynolds number: ~20,000\nDiscretization (finite element CG/DG, finite volume, etc): Finite Volume is preferred based on information from MOOSE's documentation\nModels (turbulence, porous media, etc): Turbulent\nSolver method (fully coupled, segregated, multiapps, etc): Unknown\nBase input you started from: N/A\nOperating Pressure: 15 MPa\nInlet Temperature: 320 K\nOutlet Temperature (approximate): 600 K",

How big is the system? and how many elements do you plan to use to mesh it?\nFor heat transfer, you ll be able to use correlations to compute the heat flux. Support for conjugate heat transfer will come later this year\nNote that we have fluid properties for CO2 in the carbon_dioxide optional submodule of the fluid properties module of MOOSE.

I was referring to the ones in the modules/fluid_properties/contrib/carbon_dioxide module, which are not documented (and those might be applicable too, just don't know where the supercritical regime goes).\nTHM can be used if your flow is 1D, but we do not have a turbulence model for its flow model though. We would just need to ensure that your fluid properties class has all the necessary interfaces, but the class could be extended with the necessary interfaces if it doesn't already have them.\nAlso note that there is a fully compressible NS solver, but as I understand it, it's just not actively developed (focus is mainly on weakly compressible formulation). Also I think it may not have turbulence support. @GiudGiud @grmnptr can you comment?\nI think would suggest just going for it with NS and doing a small sample problem in the supercritical regime, and then try out different formulations.",

If we want to see it grow over time, I believe the number of \ncontributors has to increase. The user base is key, as there's a clear \ncorrelation between the number of users, the ability to solve questions \nin the MOOSE discussion forum, and the overall development of the code.\n\nModFlow is, in my opinion, the perfect example of the direction \nPorousFlow should take. Without a GUI, ModFlow is quite difficult to \nmaster and prone to errors. However, with the addition of Python APIs \nand user-friendly interfaces, it became the go-to code for \nhydrogeologists. I think we can follow a similar path for \nPorousFlow\u2014facilitating adoption through a well-designed GUI. User \nexperience is crucial here.\n\nAdditionally, from my experience lecturing across Europe, I\u2019ve noticed \nthat young students are hesitant to learn a new code unless it offers a \nclear career advantage. Positioning PorousFlow as an easy-to-learn tool \ncould help attract more users.\n\nOf course, this involves significant development, but perhaps a hybrid \nbusiness model\u2014similar to what Kitware does\u2014could support this effort. \nProviding high-quality open-source software while also offering \nconsulting and custom development services might be a sustainable way \nforward.```",

So, external stresses should be able to open/close (but not over-close!) and shear fractures\nFluid and heat in fracture and bulk can change fracture aperture (which will change fracture permeability) so need to take into consideration of stresses in bulk\nGeochemistry in fracture can change fracture aperture, viz dissolution/precipitation\n\nFracture initiation and propagation (eg in hydrofracturing or electrical fracking) may then be possible",

As in, this CAD model has multiple bodies in the file, and each body (and its mesh) can be easily exported as a .stl file (though there are many options for this).

If so, are there any controls over the type of mesh (tetrahedrals vs hexahedrals)?\n\nThank you very much in advance!!!\nP.S. For reference I have included an image of the CAD model, which was created with FreeCAD. Though relatively simple, I am hoping to grow the model and design over time.",

Importing the mesh in one FileMeshGenerator will make your Mesh block fairly tidy.\nHowever, each part should be its own subdomain so you can assign equations and materials on a per-subdomain basis.\nImporting each part separately would also not easily get the mesh connectivity you need for most physics. There are ways around non-conformal meshes for some physics but not all.\n\nSince .stl files only contain the mesh, not the boundary names, is there a streamlined/easy way to import these meshes and assign boundary names for future boundary condition assignments?\n\nstl files contain the CAD, not really the mesh. In your meshing tool, I think FreeCAD, you assign the boundary names then export it to a mesh format. This export should conserve the boundary names you assigned, but it's worth checking in Paraview if it did.\n\nInstead of meshing separately, say using Gmsh or another utility, could MOOSE simply import the CAD file (in whatever format is needed) and mesh within MOOSE, again assigning boundary names? If so, are there any controls over the type of mesh (tetrahedrals vs hexahedrals)?\n\nnot at the moment. Support for meshing clean STL files is not very far away though, and we would be able to create a tet mesh there.\nFeel free to create a feature request on the libmesh repo.\nGuillaume",

The coordinates of the current quadrature point will be used as a condition to assign a specific value to some created variables. What I want to know is whether the coordinates of _q_point[_qp](0), _q_point[_qp](1) and _q_point[_qp](2) return the displaced mesh or the undisplaced mesh. Since I need the coordinates of the quadrature point under the displaced mesh, what should I do to ensure that the displaced mesh is always used?",

And the _problem or _fe_problem would refer to the displaced problem.\n\nThank you for your kind explanation. But do we have a parameter that can 'globally' set all objects to use the displaced mesh, as there are usually a number of objects used in an input file? Another question is since all the objects I have developed myself have no declared parameter called use_displaced_mesh and I don't know how to pass it to the parent class either. Sorry, I am not good at C++. In this case, can I just set use_displaced_mesh = true on each object to get all the physics in the simulation to use the displaced mesh? Or what else should I do?\nIn my simulation, the problem is set to FEProblem. Below are the results I saw from my simulation with use_displaced_mesh = true set for the mechanics only, but not for the rest of the physics. Here the I_aux represents the variation of the light intensity along the y-axis direction. As you can see in the zoomed image, the I_aux should be non-zero for nodes on the right-hand side of the red line. However, when I checked in the paraview, the values for the highlight element are unexpected. I_aux_node_1 = I_aux_node_4 = 0.0 whereas they should be around 10 or so.\nOverall view of the part\n\nZoom in on the top left corner",

So I am curious, for the tightly coupled scenario of two external programs, can I continue to use the multi-app and transfer system, for example, when I iterate in picard, since I am not sure how many times I iterate before convergence, at this time I should be in the input card how to set up the execution_time of the transfer, or should I use another function module to accomplish my current picard iteration I'm looking forward to your answer.\nVery much looking forward to your answers.",

You just need to set fixed point iteration parameters to the executioner. Notably change the max number of fixed point iterations.\n\nsince I am not sure how many times I iterate before convergence, at this time I should be in the input card how to set up the execution_time of the transfer\n\nthere are a variety of convergence criteria available, notably using a postprocessor value which is a very flexible option",
