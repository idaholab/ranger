We use this to read data into Python for analysis and doing exactly this (design space mapping, optimisation, sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo integrals, etc.). I can't comment on doing this directly in MOOSE but its quite easy to do in Python. I run system calls to MOOSE from Python scripts, as MOOSE input files are just text files its trivial to automate writing these in Python with different input variables, or set them on the command line and automate the call generation. Depending on what hardware you are running on (laptop/desktop vs HPC cluster) you will want to choose your parallelism appropriately. If you are going on a cluster its not too hard to set up parallel execution of models. There are different approaches to this, e.g. Python's built in Multiprocessing or MPI. We have internal libraries for using the latter on clusters to run arbitrary numbers in parallel. All in all, if you can get the results into Python using SEACAS then you can do what you like!",

                  "bodyText": "Hi Floyd,\nIn addition to loosening the tolerance values you have listed in your input file (resistance_tol, slip_increment_tolerance, and stol) in the trial_xtalpl block, you might also explore loosening rtol and abs_tol in the xtal_stress. Of all these options, I would recommend starting with loosening the slip tolerance parameter and leave the stress residual tolerances as the default values.\nAdditionally, the substepping option within the ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress may help keep the timestep larger, although the simulation will take longer because of substepping within the crystal plasticity stress residual calculation, see the example here: \n  \n    \n      moose/modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/crystal_plasticity/stress_update_material_based/substep.i\n    \n    \n         Line 95\n      in\n      d62c3f0\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n               maximum_substep_iteration = 10 \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nIt might also be worth checking if the crystal plasticity model(s) you are using in your simulation can handle the high strain rate. Some models have assumptions about the maximum strain rate that are used in the model derivation--that information will be available in the journal articles cited on the documentation page.\nFinally, please double check with the tensor mechanics documentation system that you are using a consistent set of kernels and strain calculators. I strongly recommend the use of the TensorMechanics/MasterAction to ensure the use of consistent kernels and strain calculators.\nHope this helps,\nStephanie",

The biggest improvement came from maximum_supstep_iteration = 5, slight changes to the defaults for the other tolerances had a positive effect, larger changes were detrimental. All said I got ~2x speed up (larger dt, slower time steps) over the first 20 steps of the simulation.\nHopefully, once the simulation gets away from the starting conditions it will improve more, we will see!\nFloyd",

Compared to a similar setup which only has two variables (same equations as the former, but the former uses a mixed formulation hence each component of the flux is an independent variable), the time difference is staggering.\nWith the current mesh and temporal refinement the standard formulation can run ~400 timesteps in an hour or two, but the mixed formulation has been running for an hour and only completed 5 timesteps. Both are being run on the same HPC and are run in parallel with 25 CPUs per simulation with 4GB of RAM per CPU.\nI wanted to know what suggestions you might have that could potentially reduce simulation time. The first thing I thought of was to hand-code the Jacobians (I'm currently using AD). Is there a tutorial that explains the MOOSE syntax for doing so in detail with an example? I'm having trouble finding one.\nAlso, this is the executioner block of the mixed formulation:\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = 'PJFNK'\n\n  nl_rel_tol = 1e-8\n  nl_abs_tol = 1e-8\n  l_tol = 1e-5\n  l_max_its = 300\n  nl_max_its = 20\n\n  dtmin = ${dt_val_min}\n  dtmax= ${dt_val}\n  \n  start_time = ${start_val}\n  end_time = ${t_val}\n   \n  [TimeStepper]\n    type = IterationAdaptiveDT\n    optimal_iterations = 15\n    iteration_window = 3\n    linear_iteration_ratio = 100\n    growth_factor=1.5\n    cutback_factor=0.5\n    dt = ${dt_val}\n  []\n  [Predictor]\n    type = SimplePredictor\n    scale = 1.0\n    skip_after_failed_timestep = true\n  []\n[]\n\nIs PJFNK or NEWTON a better choice in this situation? I thought that since I didn't hand-code the Jacobians, that NEWTON wouldn't work. But while searching I saw an older post suggesting to use NEWTON if using AD. I guess I'm not fully sure what AD does/how it works.\nThe details of the problem I'm attempting to solve are here: #26021\nI was also wondering what petsc options might help and where I can learn about them.\nI also wanted to ask about MPI- it seems that in this case the parallelization is not working as intended, as I'm getting this while it's solving:\n\nWhich seems like it's using a lot of memory and/or splitting it is actually making it slower. It is taking way much more time to run than on my local computer (which is also very, very slow, but not as slow as this) which obviously has way less computational resources.",

I don't think there is a guarantee that this is true for all cases.\nThe first thing to do here is to print the nonlinear and linear residuals and see which iteration is taking longer to converge now that there are 8 variables instead of 2.\nThen I would look at automatic scaling to see if it improves convergence.\nThen I would redo the preconditioning using a field split. With 8 variables you have to think which ones can be grouped and which ones can solved nearly on their own\nGuillaume",

So you are getting some AD machinery for every single linear (and nonlinear) residual evaluation with PJFNK. With NEWTON, there are no residual function evaluations during the linear solve so you don't incur that cost.\nIf one is somehow forced to use PJFNK (which you shouldn't be) with AD, then you should try to use a powerful preconditioner that limits the number of linear residual evaluations. You are using the default parallel preconditioner which is block Jacobi with ILU on the sub-blocks; this is a weak preconditioner that will lead to lots of linear residual evaluations.",

I thought that I set the linear tolerance to 1e-5 with the statement\nl_tol = 1e-5\nin the executioner, but that clearly isn't being applied somehow. How can I fix that?\nAlso, what are the linear and nonlinear residuals even? By my understanding the equation system setup is of the format Ax = b where A is the Jacobian, and the residuals are calculated by Ax(guess) - b. So the closer that is to zero, the closer x is to the solution. And using NEWTON is the method by which the residuals are approximated. Where do the linear/nonlinear parts come in? And should the linear tolerance be greater or less than the nonlinear tolerance?",

Both NEWTON and PJFNK are different implementations of Newton's method. With NEWTON, the A matrix is explicitly formed. With PJFNK, the action of A on vectors (which is all that is needed for a Krylov method) is approximated using finite differences. This is why residual evaluations are performed during the linear solve: for computing those finite differences\nBoth PJFNK and NEWTON require preconditioning during the linear solve. The stronger your preconditioner, the fewer linear iterations you will take. But also the stronger your preconditioner, generally the more costly each linear iteration will be.

So for 3D calculations with 8 variables, the Jacobian evaluation done by AD probably will be pretty expensive because the sparsity pattern is large. For your linear preconditioning ... you could try LU and see what happens but the dense sparsity pattern and largish system size will likely be a problem. Exploring field split as @GiudGiud suggested is probably a good idea if LU is too expensive.",

It went smoothly, but it seems from the results that the temperature of the solid domain is not effectively transferred to the fluid domain. The fluid domain is constant temperature. I suspect that the interface on both sides is independent (but it seems that the nodes on both sides are corresponding) , which bothers me very much.

The ultimate goal is to have MOOSE (with tensormechanics modulus) + my own application as a singularity container that the example code can be executed on Expanse.\nSo far I'm able to build moose.sif (I will try the dev you mentioned soon) on the cluster, now I would like to\n(1) test the build (use ./run_tests)\n(2) combine my own application (available on GitHub)\n(3) run an example code on the cluster\nI'm really appreciating if you could highlight the necessary commands for achieving this.

Is there a technique available for conducting flux statistics on cell faces and to obtain the flow on coarse-grid faces through area-weighting the flux values on fine-grid faces.\nIn the introduction to the transfer system, it is mentioned that spatial mapping between different grids can be accomplished using the transfer functionality. Consequently, is it possible to execute the entire statistical process of fine-grid iteration results and the weighted averaging process between coarse and fine grids within the transfer system? Or is it necessary to initially leverage AuxKernels or Postprocessors to conduct relevant statistics on the main app's results, followed by the spatial mapping (i.e., weighting and averaging of cells and cell faces) within the transfer system?\nI acknowledge that my query may be intricate and extensive.
