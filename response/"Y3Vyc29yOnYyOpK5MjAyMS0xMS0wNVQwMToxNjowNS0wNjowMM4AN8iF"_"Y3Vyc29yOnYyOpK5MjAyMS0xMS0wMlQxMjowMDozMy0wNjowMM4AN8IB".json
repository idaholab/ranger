I previously used Trelis software to generate the simulation-meshed-geometry-exodusll-input-files, and made them by hand. However, this next project has too many elements to insert by hand.\nDo you have any recommendations on how to effectively generate an exodus-input-file for moose, that can increase the speed for bigger projects?\nI'm thinking of writing a higher-level-programming-script to interact with the Trelis GUI and automate the \"create object\" and \"move to this location,\" processes. If there's any other way that any of you have discovered lease let me know.\nAnything helps. Thank you!",

This started the other while working with Github and doing a make clean then and attempting to make my MOOSE app which was previously working. I ran an update with Big Sur, then after updating conda, and recompiling moose, the failure occurs at:\ncd ~/projects/moose/test\nmake -j 4 # <--- build error\n./run_tests -j 4 \n\nI then went to the conda troubleshooting and failed to run the script:\ncd /tmp\ncat << EOF > hello.C\n# include ...\n\nThe failure also  prevented me from running make altogether for other cpp applications. I could not isolate the problem to Xcode, anaconda etc, so I did a factory reset and reinstalled Big Sur 11.3, dev tools etc and attempt to reinstall MOOSE.\nI then received the same failure messages after repeating the above steps. As per the MOOSE error output, I have attached the error and crash report here below.\nThank you very much in advance for any guidance,\nPaul\nmakeError.txt\nmooseEnvBuildTest.txt\npcrecpp-7ca045.cpp.txt\npcrecpp-7ca045.sh.txt",

After that, you run /Applications/Xcode which allows it to finalize anything it may need to do, and you are done.\nYou may need to adjust your xcode-select path, if you were strictly using CLT only:\nsudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app\nAlso, the reset feature might work best:\nsudo xcode-select --reset\n@marmolRBG Good to know, that you too had 12.4 to begin with. Very odd indeed, as that is the version I ended up with, which is what I began with... but now it works. Maybe Xcode needed to be... um, reinstalled?",

But just make sure that your kernels are only defined in blocks 1 and 2, so there is no activity in block 3 other than just holding the initial condition.\nPlease let me know if this works for you.",

I am sorry if this is too simple.\nI was looking to the inelastic documentation of TensorMechanics (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/materials/ComputeMultipleInelasticStress.html) which was really helpful, but I have some questions.\n\nIs there a difference between plastic and inelastic? Some objects are called PlasticBlabla.C and others InelasticBlabla.C\nLooks like in the MOOSE script (.i file) there are different way to apply plasticity: Using UserObjects and Materials or just using Materials. Why is that? Also what TensorMechanicsHardeningConstant function? It looks like is use to define the constant parameters of the inelastic laws but why these values cannot be assigned directly?\nWhen Multiple inelastic models are set, this means that different inelastic laws are applied to different blocks of the mesh?\nThanks and Im sorry if this is too simple!\nNuria",

Most of the constitutive equations use Materials. I believe crystal plasticity may use UserObjects too. User objects have a ton of applications and can serve many different purposes.\nMultiple inelastic models take care of multiple inelastic models within the same block. For example, you could think of a simulation with creep and plasticity. One needs to use a proper return mapping algorithm and, in addition, make the creep solution and the plasticity solution converge.",
