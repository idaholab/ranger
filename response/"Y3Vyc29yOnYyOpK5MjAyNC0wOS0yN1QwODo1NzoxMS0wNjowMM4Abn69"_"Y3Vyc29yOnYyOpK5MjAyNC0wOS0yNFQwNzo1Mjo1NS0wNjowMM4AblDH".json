I am using the tutorial code from RACCOON that is named \"Tutorial 2: Mode-I crack propagation\" where the full code can be found in \"tutorials/mode1_brittle_fracture/elasticity.i\". In that code the package\n[elasticity]\ntype = SmallDeformationIsotropicElasticity\nis used, and I'm wondering if it is possible to modify it to Anisotropic elasticity instead?\nIf so, what is the other module called? and how does it affect the rest of the code? and how do I apply it?\nI have looked through the library of RACOON but didn't find anything \"anisotropy\" related.\nI appreciate any help I can get.",

Also check your adaptivity setting to make sure you are not over-resolving the interfaces. You need about 3 elements through the interface between grains.\nI would start from the example input file moose/modules/phase_field/examples/grain_growth/grain_growth_2D_graintracker.i in the example and slowly make changes starting from this. I think this will be easier than trying to profile the code for your file. Try increasing the size and number of grains by a factor of 2 starting from this input file rather than trying to dramatically increasing the problem size and number of cores all at once. This will make it easier to identify issues.",

That would give a mesh size of 2000 /  1000 = 2.0 in the x and y directions. This would be a little too coarse for interface width of 3.46. You would want at least 3 elements through the interface so probably at least 1 more level of refinement at the interfaces, adaptive meshing would work well to give you that.\nThat said 6400 is A LOT of grains even for 2D. You are likely going to need a lot more cores. Best performance will be obtained at 20,000 DOF/core. It's very time consuming to troubleshoot performance and adaptivity for large simulations, which is why I strongly suggest to start with a much smaller problem and make sure your settings are working correctly before doing something this large.",

I want the FEM solution curve to be smooth. Because for other similar problems the oscillation are causing significant result difference. I am attaching a curve for one such comparative analysis. See the following:\n\n\n\nIs there any nested solve in a material property that could be less converged?\nI did not understand this part. However please see the script that I have attached.\n\n\nThanks for your interest.",
