In the object above we are doing this so that we can get PETSc to do the \"hard\" work of generating a coloring map, so I never bothered to store this data in the data structure as this data isn't needed beyond the local scope of where it's used.\nSo I would proceed like this:\n\nAllow the FeatureFloodCount object to run it's normal stages like normal (i.e. initialize, execute, finalize). This will populate your data structure with all of the rich information about each feature, it's Halo, and make many of the methods that you'll need to use for your data.\nIn finalize I created a new interface that updates data structures as necessary for queries like this one called updateFieldinfo. There are already several in there for showing the halos, unique grain maps, etc.  I would recommend that you start by just putting your new logic in that method to perform that double loop and populate a new data structure with a list (or vector) of neighbors for each feature.\nCopy and paste the code from the PolycrystalUserObject base to populate your new data structure. For debugging, I would recommend that you just print your data right to the terminal. Something like this:\n\ngrain_id, neighbor_ids\n1: 4,5,9\n2: 1,3,5\n3: 1,2,7,8\n...\n\n\nCreate a new interface in FeatureVolumeVectorPostprocessor to get your data back out. I wouldn't recommend that you try to do your own I/O. You are better off using existing MOOSE interfaces. So if you can populate new vectors in this object, you'll get all your data out in the normal MOOSE way: CSV files, Exodus files, etc.",

I think this is the purpose of writing this object.\nthe number of edges per grain.\nthe number of vertices (corners) per grain.\n\nAccording to your suggestion,you are going to have to look through the FeatureFloodCount object a bit and understand what's there. I just tried to read the code to understand FeatureFloodCount, but I found this is difficult for beginners like me. So, could you share some basic documents with me, such as the program framework of FeatureFloodCount.C, the entry-level information of this algorithm, etc., so that I can better understand the FeatureFloodCount object.\nFinally, I am very sorry to reply you after such a long time. I hope that I could complete the editing of this object with your help and make some contributions to moose, which will also give me a deeper understanding of moose.\nThanks\nwei peng",

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI am a new MOOSE user trying to simulate some basic elastic deformation. At the moment, I have a solid with a given density initially responding to the gravity loading, with some pressure boundary at its front. I have a first input file detecting the gravity equilibrium with a given tolerance. Then I use the resulting exodus file for the initial mesh and conditions in my second input file where I want to apply different time-dependent forcings.\nThe steady state detection runs as expected, however once I run the second input file with the exodus file in steady state (with the same boundary conditions), I still get a relatively high initial response before a new steady state is reached. While I would have expected a smooth start without very minor variations in displacement as the system should already be in steady state.\nBelow are the input files for gravity equilibrium and transient evolution. In an attempt to narrow down my problem, the input file for transient evolution doesn't include any additional forcings.\nTwo notes:\n\nTrials at the default steady state tolerance did not solve the problem.\nTransient evolution is properly starting with the mesh and system of the steady state at the last time step.\n\nI built those two input files based on MOOSE examples (especially MASTODON) but I probably missed some conditions/objects or set some parameters with values that are preventing my system from staying in steady state at the restart... I tried to find the solution by myself, but I am now stuck without explanation.\nAny help would be much appreciated!

I now see that you are trying to run a gravity analysis using restart. We don't usually use restart analysis for the gravity step. We use the controls block to switch off the inertia kernel and other time-derivative-dependent terms (damping, for instance) in the first 2 time steps. This makes sure that a static analysis is performed at these time steps and the inertia kernels are switched on when needed. I think this is a much simpler way to perform gravity analysis. We have an example that shows this: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/mastodon/examples/example14.html\nThere is a note that specifically talks about gravity. Please let me know if this method works for you. If not, I can try to help.",
