An MWE command and input file are given at the bottom, along with the error message. Some observations:\n\nSplitting works fine with other mixed-dimensional meshes (e.g. combined 3D cube and 2D rectangle).\nSome of the files appear to write without issue before the segfault. My guess is these are sections of the mesh that don't contain the lower dimensional block.\nI have tried \"pre-generating\" the mesh using --mesh-only, and splitting a .e file instead, but the issue persists.\nThis happens no matter how many pieces I split the mesh into, or how many processes/how much memory per process I allocate.\n\nAny advice on how to work around this, or if there is likely to be a fix any time soon, would be much appreciated - thanks!\nmpirun myapp-opt -i mesh.i --split-mesh 24 --split-file split.cpr\n\nmesh.i\n[Mesh]\n  [cube]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 3\n    nx = 10\n    ny = 10\n    nz = 10\n  []\n  [top]\n    type = LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator\n    input = cube\n    sidesets = top\n  []\n[]\n\n\n\nError message\nSplitting 24 ways...\n    - writing 1 files per process...\nMeta data are written into ./split.cpr/meta_data_mesh.rd.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrimary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned\na non-zero exit code.

When I separately compile the /framework folder in the MOOSE submodule in Moltres, this error also occurs. In addition, I downloaded and compiled MOOSE (excluding the Moltres section) according to the tutorials on the MOOSE official website, and the compilation and testing process of MOOSE was very smooth at this time.\nIn fact, I successfully installed Molteres and MOOSE in late March. So is there a way for me to use a Moose version from March as a submodule instead of the [Moose @ af38e9f(https://github.com/arfc/moltres)] , which is Moltres now using.\nThe error log is attached.\nerror_log.txt",

          "bodyText": "Dear community,\nI am trying to set a TH model for a storage case using porous flow. I have read documentation like this but still need help. I made two cylinders in my mesh which are supposed to represent boreholes. The outer surface of one of the cylinders is also chosen as the BC for temperature. The material properties of the cylinders i.e. boreholes are selected in a way to represent a column on water (density=1000, porosity=1, ...). When I ran the simulation, only the outer boundary of the hot borehole heated up. In the following, you see some plots. The slice shows the hot area around the hot borehole while I expected it to heat up inside the borehole. Curves also pass through the section. As it can be seen the temperature value drops inside the borehole. The pressure behaves more normally and is increased in the borehole. My MOOSE input file and mesh are stored in my git repository at https://github.com/jack-fi/input_for_moose\n\nI very much appreciate your help.",

Let's say I have some data that I want to associate with a node but all I have are arbitrary coordinates. I can probably get away with only needing to do this mapping once at startup (in my Kernel's initialSetup()) or once per timestep (timestepSetup()), so maybe efficiency isn't terribly important. I just worry about doing some $O\\left(N\\right)$ search on a model with millions of nodes.",
