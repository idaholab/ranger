          "bodyText": "Hello! I am trying to get moose to output a .cvs file that I need for post processing in MATLAB. I am looking to create a .csv or .txt file that contains the X and Y coordinate of each node and the associated variable called etab0 for each time step. For example, if I had 4 nodes, the output file would be something like:\nx   y   eta\n1   1   .2\n1   2   .4\n2   1   .3\n2   2    .6\nand the next file containing the next data set from the next time step or:\ntime   x   y   eta\n1       1   1   .2\n1       1   2   .4\n1       2   1   .3\n1       2   2    .6\n2       1   1   .2\n2       1   2   .4\n2       2   1   .3\n2       2   2    .6\nI see the NodalVariableValue Post Processor however it requires a specified node and I want all the nodes as my simulation is more the 4 nodes. Is there a \"all\" command for this? Thank you\nAlso: it doesn't need to be the exact format I just need the variable and the associated coordinates for all nodes. And I would also take just the variable associated with each node for each time step and I could write a function in excel/MATLAB to fill in the x and y location.",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI am trying to simulate fluid flow, based on the thesis attached. So far, I have managed to successfully get it working, however the next step is to add a volumetric heat source function which varies with time. The function is currently defined as a ParsedFunction.\nI am using INSFV implementation and can provide more detail if needed. I was previously using the HeatSource Kernel when not using Navier Stokes, so want to know if there is an equivalent.\nI tried using a portion of the NavierStokesFV module, however no luck...\nMy attempt:\n[Modules]\n    [NavierStokesFV]\n        pin_pressure = true\n        pinned_pressure_type = average-uo\n        external_heat_source = volumetric_decay_func\n        block = fuel_salt\n        density = ${rho}\n        dynamic_viscosity = ${mu}\n       []\n[]\n\n\nIf this is a trivial solve, the second part of my question pertains to using functions to alter material properties, such as density, with temperature which seemingly requires FunctorMaterial properties.\nHappy to expand on this!

(not apply heat over the whole domain).\nIn that case, you can still use a FVBodyForce FVKernel on the side to define this.\nFor material properties, you will want to use a GeneralFunctorFluidProps material.\nMany of the fluid properties will work without extra work in NavierStokes.\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/FluidProperties/index.html\nDo you have a working input without a heat source right now?\nGuillaume",

I have (partially) succeeded in implementing these suggestions.\nFYI I am not using the Navier Stokes module at this stage, and am instead using the respective FVKernels.\n\nFVBodyForce was exactly what was needed for the implementation of a heat source in a specified block.\nGeneralFunctorFluidProps was also what was required, where my fluid properties are now defined using TemperaturePressureFunctionFluidProperties.\n\nMy only follow up is due to confusion regarding the use of the functor properties given by GeneralFunctorFluidProps:\nCurrently this is my GeneralFunctorFluidProps block:\n[fuel_salt]\n    type = GeneralFunctorFluidProps\n    block = fuel_salt\n    fp = salt_fluid_properties\n\n    pressure = pressure\n    T_fluid = T\n    characteristic_length = 0.2\n    speed = velocity_xy\n\n    force_define_density = true\n[]\n\nWhich I believe is correct, as it has no issues being read in all my FVKernels, except one...\nIt does not work for FVHeatConductionTimeDerivative, where density_name is requested instead of rho, like the other FVKernels I am using for NS. I have tried simply defining an ADParsedMaterial which defines a new density, which should vary the same. However my follow up question is whether I can do this in a different way?\nHope that makes sense! Thank you for this advice!\nJake",
