That is, I have an FV elemental variable  (an adCoupledValue in the interface kernel) and an adCoupledGradient that is the gradient of that FV elemental variable, and I need to evaluate the adCoupledGradient on both sides of the interface. I have not quite been able to figure out how to do that. For adFunctors I can just evaluate them at elemFromFace and neighborFromFace. If I assume that I can pass components of the gradient as variable1 and variable2, the I can use the FVInterfaceKernel system to generate differences in the gradient components:\nconst auto gradient_diff = var1().getElemValue(&_face_info -> elem())-var2().getElemValue(_face_info -> neighborPtr())\nBut that is clumsy - it would be better to directly evaluate the adCoupledGradient at the two elements. There should be a simple way of  doing that, I think.",

Yes, using\nADRealVectorValue gradient_diff = var1().adGradSln(&_face_info->elem())-var2().adGradSln(_face_info->neighborPtr)));\nseems to work to generate a difference in gradients across the interface. At least the compiler does not puke.\nI also need to generate differences of nonlinear variables, say mag_x, across the interface. I managed (I think) to generate differences between elemental values using\nparams.addRequiredParam(\"mag_x\",  );\n..\n_mag_x(getFunctor(\"mag_x\")),\n...\nconst auto mag_x_diff = _mag_x(elemFromFace()) - _mag_x(neighborFromFace());\nthat is, I passed the nonlinear variable as an adFunctor so I could access the elemFromFace routine. I could not use the adSln(&_face_info->elem()) for the functor or if I pass the nonlinear variable as adCoupledValue. I am not sure if it makes sense to pass the nonlinear variable mag_x as a functor. And alternative, I guess, would be to build up the interface residual by running twice with var1 and var2 being the different nonlinear variables in each call, but that seems a little clumsy.",

Things certainly have changed since I last visited running Peacock on WSL(2).\nFrom what I am reading, Windows 11 folks will enjoy native GL support without needing to Install VcXsrv. Their only pre-requisite is to install their optimized video card drivers (NVIDIA or AMD). While the rest of us still on Windows 10 continue to need VcXsrv. Considering myself something of a power user, even I was confused on Microsof's literature about WSL2/native GL support (but not on Windows 10).\nWindows 10 has changed somewhat from when I last created WSL instructions. Instead of export DISPLAY=localhost:0, it is now necessary to export your native host's IP address. I also found it necessary to disable access control when launching VcXsrv.\nHere's precisely everything I did:\n\nOpen PowerShell as an Administrator, and update WSL, set version to 2, restart it:\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32> wsl --update\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32> wsl --set-default-version 2\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32> wsl --shutdown\n\nInstalled Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS using Microsoft Store\nInstalled VcXsrv and launched it with the following changes\n\n\n\nLaunch Ubuntu 22.04.1 and perform the following commands:\nsudo apt-get udpate\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install x11-apps libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx\ncurl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\nbash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/mambaforge3\nexport PATH=~/mambaforge3/bin:$PATH\nmamba init\nexit\n\nLaunch Ubuntu 22.04.1 again, and perform the following commands:\nmamba install openssl=1\nconda config --add channels https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmamba create -n moose moose-libmesh moose-tools\nmamba create -n peacock moose-peacock python=3.10\nmamba activate moose\nmkdir ~/projects; cd ~/projects\ngit clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose\ncd moose\ngit checkout master\ncd test\nmake -j 16\ncd tests/geomsearch/3d_moving_penetration\nmamba activate peacock\nexport DISPLAY=192.168.158.146:0\n../../../../python/peacock/peacock -i pl_test1.i\n\n\nObviously other's IP addresses will be different.\nI am going to go ahead and post this. And run through it again using a fresh Ubuntu 22.04. I may have missed an apt-get install.",
