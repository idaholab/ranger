          "bodyText": "Hello all,\nI've been looking into the existing INSADSmagorinskyEddyViscosity kernel, with a view to try implementing Van Driest damping in the future.\nI'm no expert in turbulence modelling and LES, and am having trouble understanding the term which is added to the momentum equation for this kernel. In the documentation, I believe this Reynolds stress term is:\n$\\nabla\\cdot\\left ( -\\nu_{SGS}\\rho\\nabla\\overrightarrow{u} \\right )$\nFrom my own reading, I would expect the sub-grid scale viscosity to be multiplied by the strain rate tensor, rather than grad_u. Generally speaking, I was under the impression that shear stress in a newtonian fluid is proportional to the strain rate, which in 3D is not necessarily the same as the velocity gradient.\nI have also encountered a derivation for Reynolds stresses which leads to the following:\n$\\tau_{SGS} = 2\\rho\\nu_{SGS}(S_{ij}-\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\partial u_{k}}{\\partial x_{k}}\\delta_{ij}) - \\frac{2}{3}\\rho k_{SGS}\\delta_{ij}$\nWhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker delta. I gather the additional terms on the RHS, besides the strain rate tensor, are correcting for some error which would otherwise be associated with this approach. How $\\nu_{SGS}$ is determined differs depending on which turbulence model is being implemented. For the Smagorinsky model, we would define the sub-grid scale viscosity as in the documentation, and substitute into this equation to find the Reynolds stress term.\nI'm hoping someone can help reconcile these different approaches: Viscosity_SGS * grad_u, Viscosity_SGS * StrainRateTensor, and the last equation with the error correction terms, and help me understand why the form given in the documentation is used.\nThanks!",

It is completely unvalidated, because I found MOOSE to be too slow for running 3D LES just given the lack of ability to do efficient preconditioning for this type of system. I had based the formulation off of what was given in this paper:\nBouffanais, Roland, Michel O. Deville, and Emmanuel Leriche. \u201cLarge-Eddy Simulation of the Flow in a Lid-Driven Cubical Cavity.\u201d Physics of Fluids 19, no. 5 (May 1, 2007): 055108. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2723153.\nAnd yeah, my attention was only being paid to incompressible flows at the time. In that paper, you can see that the eddy viscosity is indeed just summed with the normal viscosity. Also, you have to mind that what's implemented in the kernel is the weak form, so gradient multiplied by the test function gradient corresponds to a laplacian in the strong form PDE.",

Possibly unrelated if the issues are to do with preconditioning rather than mesh resolution requirements, but I've been mulling over how to an appropriate grid size, given the absence of a k-epsilon or k-omega model to estimate the integral length scale.\nThanks both for your help in clarifying what's currently implemented - hopefully this will enable me to properly include some damping functions for the existing kernel.",

However, when using the new system, stresses are stored in the global tensor 'cauchy_stress'. This means to extract vonmises stresses you must use a rank two aux kernel.\nThis is not a huge issue, but it would be good if the master action could intelligently switch between looking for stress and cauchy stress depending on the system in use.",

I think this is my favorite, though.\nOption 2 would cause huge amounts of breakage. Also, we have to think about how far to carry the convention of explicitly spelling out the stress type. Would we call it vonmises_cauchy_stress, for instance?\nOption 3 would require extra compute resources and would potentially be confusing.\nI'm interested in what others think.",

So can FSP be used in the eigenvalue calculation of MOOSE (just like the steady or transient calculation)\uff1f\n\n\n\nI found that compared to InversePowerMethod, MOOSE now recommends Eigenvalue for eigenvalue calculation. I now have an Executioner for InversePowerMethod that I did before. But when I wanted to transform it from InversePowerMethod to Eigenvalue, I found some differences between InversePowerMethod and Eigenvalue. For example, in InversePowerMethod, I will set xdiff and bnorm, but these are not available in Eigenvalue. How can this be solved?",
