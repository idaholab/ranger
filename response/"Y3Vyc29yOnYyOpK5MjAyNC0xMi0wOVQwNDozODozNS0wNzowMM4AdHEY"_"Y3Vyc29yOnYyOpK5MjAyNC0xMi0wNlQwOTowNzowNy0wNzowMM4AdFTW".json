          "bodyText": "Dear Moose community,\nI'd like to ask a question on the very good explanations given here:\nmooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/convergence.html\nIn the section on fluids the following equation is given:\n$R=V \\cdot \\left|\\kappa\\right| \\cdot \\rho \\cdot \\epsilon / \\mu$\nCan you please clarify what $\\left|\\kappa\\right|$ is?\nCross-checking here my guess is, that $\\left|\\kappa\\right|$ is the determinant of the permeability tensor (so, a physical unit of [mass] \u00b7 [length]^5 / [time] ?). For a gravel with a isotropic permeability of 1E-7 m\u00b2 and default SI-units this would lead to $\\left|\\kappa\\right| = 1E-21 m^6$. For water, a volume of interest of 1m\u00b3 and $\\epsilon=1 Pa/m$ this would lead to $R=1E-15 kg \\cdot m^5 / s$.\nBut on the other hand, the value calculated above is much smaller than the $R_{fluid}=10E-9 \\cdot V$ given in section \"Scaling the variables\" in mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/convergence.html.\nThanks for you help in advance.\nEdit: Unit of R.",

I am new to the MOOSE environment; I just finished installing it on my machine and was able to run two of the example problems in MOOSE.\nHowever, I am also working on sintering and was trying to replicate the simulation in Biswas's 2018 paper but I am not really sure where to start. I have seen a tutorial on creating a new application by just copying and modifying the input and mesh files from any of MOOSE's in-built examples. So my question is, where did you find these files (i.e, the folder that contains the input, mesh, src, etc.) for the simulation in the paper? In short, as a beginner, what do you suggest would be a good place to start? Thank you very much.\nRegards\nBuhari.",

What's the meaning of the Picard residual in the moose_as_parent.i and petsc_transient_as_sub.i?\nRecently, I still study the code in \\modules\\external_petsc_solver\\. I encounter some puzzles...\n1.\nIt seems that the moose_as_parent.i tells a story of\n\u2202u/\u2202t - \u2207\u00b7\u2207u \u2013 10000v = 0\nAnd v comes from the transferred value from the u in petsc_transient_as_sub.i. But what does the petsc_transient_as_sub.i say? From the code comment of PETScDiffusionFDM.C, it seems that the govern function is\n\u2202u/\u2202t = \u22022u/\u2202x2 + \u22022u/\u2202y2\nHowever, I have two questions from its other comments.\n1.1 the comment says  At t=0: u(x,y) = exp(crrr), if r=PetscSqrtReal((x-.5)(x-.5) + (y-.5)*(y-.5)) < .125. If that is right, at t = 0, x = 0.5, y = 0.5, the u must be 1, right? However, the initial condition of u at the center point from the *.e file(moose_as_parent_out_sub_app0.e) generated by MOOSE is 0 not 1... What's the wrong with it?\n1.2 the comment also says that\n\nBoundary conditions:\nDrichlet BC:\nAt x=0, x=1, y=0, y=1: u = 0.0\nNeumann BC:\nAt x=0, x=1: du(x,y,t)/dx = 0\nAt y=0, y=1: du(x,y,t)/dy = 0\n\nI also find similar things in the code PETScDiffusionFDM.C\n for (j = ys; j < ys + ym; j++)\n  {\n    for (i = xs; i < xs + xm; i++)\n    {\n      nc = 0;\n      row.j = j;\n      row.i = i;\n      if (PETSC_TRUE && (i == 0 || i == Mx - 1 || j == 0 || j == My - 1))\n      {\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 1.0;\n      }\n      else if (PETSC_FALSE && i == 0)\n      { /* Left Neumann */\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 1.0;\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i + 1;\n        vals[nc++] = -1.0;\n      }\n      else if (PETSC_FALSE && i == Mx - 1)\n      { /* Right Neumann */\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 1.0;\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i - 1;\n        vals[nc++] = -1.0;\n      }\n      else if (PETSC_FALSE && j == 0)\n      { /* Bottom Neumann */\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 1.0;\n        col[nc].j = j + 1;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = -1.0;\n      }\n      else if (PETSC_FALSE && j == My - 1)\n      { /* Top Neumann */\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 1.0;\n        col[nc].j = j - 1;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = -1.0;\n      }\n      else\n      { /* Interior */\n        col[nc].j = j - 1;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = -sy;\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i - 1;\n        vals[nc++] = -sx;\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = 2.0 * (sx + sy) + a;\n        col[nc].j = j;\n        col[nc].i = i + 1;\n        vals[nc++] = -sx;\n        col[nc].j = j + 1;\n        col[nc].i = i;\n        vals[nc++] = -sy;\n      }\n      ierr = MatSetValuesStencil(Jpre, 1, &row, nc, col, vals, INSERT_VALUES);\n      CHKERRQ(ierr);\n    }\n  }\nHowever, I find there is a PETSC_FALSE near these Neumaan comment, it seems that program statements of else if (PETSC_FALSE && i == 0), else if (PETSC_FALSE && i == Mx - 1), else if (PETSC_FALSE && j == 0), else if (PETSC_FALSE && j == My - 1), will not be executed by default... is this a paradox???\nI will show Q2 in another discusssion...",

The first time it is called, it only converged to the requested tolerance   nl_rel_tol = 1e-6 then the next time it's uses the updated v field and converges firther, on the 3rd solve it is already tight and the v field does not change again, so  that's why the residual is very small",

Things like what an example is about, what functional is tested, what result to expect, etc.\nOr where can I find another more detailed beginner's tutorial.\nThanks in advance.\n(Optional) code in question / simulation log / errors\nNo response\nEncountering Errors?
