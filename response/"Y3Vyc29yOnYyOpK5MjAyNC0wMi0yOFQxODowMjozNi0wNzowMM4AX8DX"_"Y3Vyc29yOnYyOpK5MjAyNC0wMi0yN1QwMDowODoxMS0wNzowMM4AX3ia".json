          "bodyText": "Hello,\nthis is an outsourced discussion from #26788:\nA simulation of an unsaturated soil with a heatsource is done to fit experimental data. While the temperatures are fitting very nicely, the capillary pressure is still a bite of a riddle.\nIn the porous flow module,  the van genuchten function for \"capillary pressure\" is used, originating from the equation for saturation as a function of the pressure head - meaning that the capillary pressure would be the same as the matric potential?\nThe results of the experiment are given as matric potential (which would be the capillary pressure according to this), however the measured potential is way more sensitive than the one from the simulation (see image below).\n\nThe only way I could think of making the capillary pressure more sensivity would be, if the curve jump at a certain saturation, so that the capillary pressure could react fast and strong to small changes in saturation at thie specified range. This would not be possible with the relatively simple sigmoidal VG formulation though.\nA suggestion for a solution to this problem was made by  Durner (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/93WR02676), extending the function to account for multimodal poresize distribution, maybe this could be implemented?\nCheers",

In order to remedy the conflict, you need to start over (clean your partially built copy of MOOSE).\ncd /Users/liumiao/projects/moose\ngit clean -xfd\ngit submodule foreach --recursive git clean -xfd\nNext, you'll need to build your own copy of PETSc, libMesh, and WASP manually (the libraries previously being supplied by Conda) using your Homebrew MPI stack . Assuming everything is clean at this point, and your Homebrew stack is the only stack present:\n\nVerify Compilers are set\n\necho $CC $CXX $FC\nmpicc mpicxx mpif90\nIf the above echo results are different, you need to set them according:\nexport CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx FC=mpif90 F90=mpif90 F77=mpif77\nNote: If you needed to run the above export, then this needs to be done each time you start a new terminal window and wish to use MOOSE.\n\nVerify MPI wrappers are available:\n\nwhich $CC $CXX $FC $F77\nThe above should return paths to your MPI wrappers. If you don't see 4 paths being returned, that means one is missing, and you need to install it using Brew.\n\nIf the above commands are good, you can proceed to building the PETSc, libMesh, and WASP dependencies:\n\nexport MOOSE_JOBS=6   # This is how many cores your machine has\nexport METHODS=opt    # This tells libMesh to only build the optimized method (speed things up)\ncd /Users/liumiao/projects/moose/scripts\n./update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh\n./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh\n./update_and_rebuild_wasp.sh\nNote: building each of these takes time. If your machine has 6 cores, I would estimate about 30 minutes to complete all three.\n\nBuild MOOSE. If none of the above failed, we can now build MOOSE:\n\ncd /Users/liumiao/projects/moose/test\nmake -j $MOOSE_JOBS\nIf there were any errors during any of the above, please run the ./diagnostics.sh script again in moose/scripts and post the results!

Usually on older moose releases, I was capable of running my simulations on 24 nodes using MPI tasks and threads (e.g SLURM setup : --nodes=24 --cpus-per-task=7 --ntasks-per-node=4). But now I have to use the newer moose release (post Oct 2022 releases) and now I can't use more than 8 nodes. I have a mesh of around 8 million elements and my executable link looks like the following: mpiexec   -n 96 mooseapp-opt --distributed-mesh -i  INPUT.i  --n-threads=7\nKeep in mind that the mesh did not change at all and no errors are received when running tests. Also, the main reason why I used to use threading before is because it allowed me to use many nodes in moose older releases. Now however, it doesn't matter if I use threads or not because in both ways I will only be able to run on up to 8 nodes only. Could someone help me, please?",
