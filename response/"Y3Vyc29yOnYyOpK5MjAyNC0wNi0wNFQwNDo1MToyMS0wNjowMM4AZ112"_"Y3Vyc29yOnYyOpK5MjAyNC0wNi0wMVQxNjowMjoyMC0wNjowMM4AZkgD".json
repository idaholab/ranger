If you cannot get a converged result even with a stronger preconditioner, I would test whether your preconditioning matrix is a good representation of the operator using -snes_test_jacobian on a smaller problem.\nA bisect can be a good debugging choice.

But I am unable to apply traction boundary conditions. As suggested in one of the previous discussion, I have tried using 'Constantrate' for force boundary condition (for simple tension test). But, as the mesh size changes, the displacement order changes significantly in such a way that I couldn't corelate the mesh size with constant force applied. I also tried applying pressure condition in NOSPD, but it shows some segmentation fault error. In Peridynamics module also, there is no example for traction bcs.\nPlease help me in this. I need to know how  'Constantrate' kernel can be used for force loading. Secondly, how else a traction boundary condition can be applied (other than using Pressure BC). It would be very helpful if an input file for simple tension test can be shared.",
