I found that when I set up the two-particle along x-direction as an initial condition, the simulation itself ran well but I could not see the reaction force/advection velocity from Paraview.\nSince the physics for two-particle sintering should not rely on two-particle orientation for isotropic diffusion, I wanted to know why I could not see the reaction force/advection velocity. Is it ok to use it for two-particle along x-direction? Do I need to change rotation_constant/translation_constant/stiffness_constant?\nThanks very much,\nKaijie",

This is because the GeneralUserObject does not have access to the _factory object or _problem object. I have tried inheriting my object from the Action class as well. But this doesn't really work, lots of compiler errors with multiple functions being defined with GeneralUserObject and Action. I have tried looking at examples in the Geochemistry and chemical reactions modules but they make the user add in the variables themselves. The problem is that in the future i will be needing to add hundreds of species and i don't want the input file to be super long, might switch to an addition input file for that. So my question is: Can we create nonlinear variables and add them to the problem using GeneralUserObjects?\nIf this is not the case, the other idea i had was to create a AddSpeciesAction that takes in my SpeciesDefinition user object as a parameter. It would then iterate though the species and add them as variables. But im not sure how to add parameters of custom types. Is there a way to add parameters of custom types?\nThanks,\nZack",

I have attached the paper below for reference. By solving Eqn. (9) in 1D and choosing the appropriate dirichlet boundary conditions for either end of the domain as shown in the input file, I was able to obtain vacancy profiles for different supersaturations. However, I could only solve the problem when the bulk free energy expression is in a polynomial form and couldn't do with the free energy expression given in the paper (see Eqn 20) because of the logarithm terms. I did specify in the kernel to use a Taylor expansion form for the logarithms when the value is less than 1e-04  and the source file is attached below. I need help in solving for the vacancy profile when a free energy expression with logarithms is considered.\nI did see satisfactory results when I considered polynomial form, as it clearly shows that the critical nuclei decrease with an increase in supersaturation. The image is attached below and the arrow points to an increase in supersaturation of vacancies. Also, it would also be very helpful  if anyone can tell me how to solve the same problem in spherical coordinates.\nSemenov, Woo - 2012 - Phase-field modeling of void formation and growth under irradiation(3).pdf\nADChemicalPotential.txt\nSteady-state_nucleation.txt",

CoefReaction and CoupledForce are very simple kernels, you could very easily modify them.",
