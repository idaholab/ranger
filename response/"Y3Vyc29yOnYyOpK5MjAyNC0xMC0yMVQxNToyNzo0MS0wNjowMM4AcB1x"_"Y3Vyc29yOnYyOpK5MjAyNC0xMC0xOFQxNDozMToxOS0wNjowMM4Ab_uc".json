Every time I modify a header file or source file, I have to enter the following commands from the official website:\nmake clobberall\nmake -j 6\nto achieve recompilation. However, I realize that this takes too much time. How can I improve this?\nFor example, if I only modify example.h, using\nmake clobberall\nmake -j 6\nwill recompile all my files, which takes a lot of time. Is there a command that allows me to only recompile the example.h file?\nI believe this will greatly increase my efficiency.

Can I use this to define the expression for energy using DerivativeParsedMaterial? In this case, what will be the coupled_variable?

I have some custom kernels that don't have the best convergence but work, so I get a lot of time steps. I have noticed these files \"corrupt\" after 998 exodus files being created.\nRight now, I have to set my interval to a value and guess an end time so it doesn't exceed the 998 file limit. Is there a more elegant solution to this where MOOSE will stop after making 998 files? Or is it possible to have an adaptive mesh that only makes one exodus file? The size of the file will not be an issue. I have copied some of my code below.
