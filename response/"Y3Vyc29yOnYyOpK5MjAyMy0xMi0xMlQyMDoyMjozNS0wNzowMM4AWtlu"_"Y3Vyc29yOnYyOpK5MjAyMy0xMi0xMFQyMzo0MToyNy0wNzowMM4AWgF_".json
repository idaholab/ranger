          "bodyText": "Hello!\nI am currently trying to use the stochastic tools module to train a gaussian process model, but am having issues with the hyperparameters.\nMy basic setup is this: I load in my training data from CSV files (using CSVSampler for X and VectorPostprocessor for Y) and specify the \"Signal Variance\", \"Noise Variance\", and \"Length Factor\" for a Matern covariance function with p = 1 (nu = 3/2). I also run the same model (same inputs, hyperparameters, and covariance function) in python using sklearn just to have a reference point. I am able to get a good, general model working on python, but when I use those same hyperparameters in MOOSE, when I go to evaluate the model using my testing data, it only predicts a vector of ~0's (the given values are ~4*10^-301, which is zero). I have gone into both codes and found the actual used hyperparameters for these evaluations, and they do match.\nI believe the issue has to do with how I am training the algorithm, but I am not sure where. An issue that may be wrong is in the length factor HP. For this one, MOOSE requires an input for each feature, but since I have 102 features, I added in a few lines that takes in the input length factor and copies this into a 1x102 vector, then uses that vector for the input. I am not sure if this is maybe causing an unforeseen consequence somewhere, so I thought I'd mention it.\nI have also tried using the 'adam' tuning algorithm, but this also does not give any better results. (I have tired with batch sizes from 1-50, itterations from 10-1000, and with learning rates from 0.001 - 10).\nHere is the training input file:\n# =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+ USER INPUTS =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=\n\nX_filename = \"X_train.csv\"\n\n# Hyperparameters\nsignal_variance = 0.01\nnoise_variance = 0.01\nlength_factor = 0.01\np = 1\n\n# =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\n[StochasticTools]\n[]\n\n[Samplers]\n  [X_train]\n    type = CSVSampler\n    samples_file = ${X_filename}\n    execute_on = 'initial'\n  []\n[]\n\n[VectorPostprocessors]\n  [Y_train]\n    type = CSVReader\n    csv_file = 'Y_train.csv'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Covariance]\n  [Matern_32]\n    type = MaternHalfIntCovariance\n\tconstant_length_factor = True\n    signal_variance = ${signal_variance}\n    noise_variance = ${noise_variance}\n    length_factor = \"${length_factor}\"\n\tp = ${p}\n  []\n[]\n\n[Trainers]\n  [train]\n    type = GaussianProcessTrainer\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n    covariance_function = 'Matern_32'\n    standardize_params = 'false' #Center and scale the training params\n    standardize_data = 'false' #Center and scale the training data\n    sampler = X_train\n    response = Y_train/${column_name}\n\t# Tuning\n\ttuning_algorithm = 'adam'\n\ttune_parameters = 'signal_variance length_factor'\n\t# tune_parameters = 'signal_variance'\n\titer_adam = 100\n\tbatch_size = 20\n\tlearning_rate_adam = 10\n\t\n  []\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  [out]\n    type = SurrogateTrainerOutput\n    trainers = 'train'\n\tfile_base = \"Trained_Model\"\n    execute_on = FINAL\n  []\n[]\n\nTo make my life simpler, I already standardized my X, so that is why those options are false. I also run this through a shell script where I input my hyperparameters there, so you can ignore the values on the top of the file. Those are just there to initialize the variables.\nAny advise on this? I have tried a large range of hyperparameters for the MOOSE GP model, but nothing has given results better than a vector of zeros (my actual Y's are in the ~2000 range).\nI am pretty stuck, so I am willing to try just about anything.\nThanks!\nCharlie",

I recommend two things:\n\nFor your verification, benchmark MOOSE and Python on lower dimensional problem, maybe 10.\nUse dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of length factors. A simple PCA should help you.\n\nReach out for any further questions.\nSom",

However, we do have a large number of training points (~2000).\nI also used a much smaller dataset (8 features, ~1000 points), and it was still predicting zeros, so the error persists.\nThe output of both is in the form\ngp_surroagte, gp_surrogate_std\n1.39e-313, 1.39e-313\n4.66e-313, 1.39e-313\n4.66e-313, 1.39e-313\n4.66e-313, 1.39e-313\n..., ...\nand really just repeats like that for all points.\nSo for some reason, it is only predicting zeros with 0-std. I assume it has to be with the code I added in (as this is the only difference between my code and the original), but I am not sure where the error would arise?\nThanks!\nCharlie",

To do this, I've used an initial condition to give the \"porepressure\" variable a value using the \"PieceWiseMultilinear\" function.  My mesh is divided into two blocks: only the lower block contains water. At the interface between these two blocks (\"aquifers\" boundary), the porepressure variable is set to 0.\nMy problem is that Moose returns this error :\n\nWhy the pressure is out of range? Is there a lower limit below which Moose will not take a pressure into account? If so, how can this problem be solved?\nThanks!\nLucas\nHere is my code with my mesh and the file with the values of the \"porepressure\" variable:\npressure_out_of_range.zip",

Therefore a flux (e.g. energy) is needed to normalize the value over the area.\nI also doubt that this assumption is realistic. Let's start with a borehole. We know the temperature of the fluid at the top of the open borehole. This temperature then rises to the bottom of the borehole (or to reservoir temperature)depending on the rock properties. In modeling, a temperature at a point (open top hole) is often specified as Dirichlet-BC assuming a certain fluid flow.\nIf you want to have a certain temperature a long a line, I would use the PorousFlowPolyLineSink for fluid flux only. For temperature I would define the line of interested as Nodeset (e.g. using BoundingBoxNodeSetGenerator) and add a Dirichlet-BC for temperature.",
