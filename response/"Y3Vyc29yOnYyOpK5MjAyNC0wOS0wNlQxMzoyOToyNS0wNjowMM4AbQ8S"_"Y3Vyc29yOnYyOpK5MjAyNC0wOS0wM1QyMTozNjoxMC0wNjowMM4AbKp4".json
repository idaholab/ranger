I've been generating a mesh on the fly, and then using SubdomainBoundingBoxGenerator to target the specific area I'm interested in and further SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator to apply a BC to this zone. It works just fine when I apply a non-null Dirichlet BC on that small zone, but as soon as I was to keep it free with the rest of the side on a null Dirichlet, it's keeping it to a null Dirichlet too instead of letting it move. Do you know how I could prevent the decoupling_bottom boundary to be set to 0 instead of staying free? I've been searching the discussions and the doc but couldn't find a fix.\nThe input file can be found here\nThank you a lot in advance for your help! :)",

I just wanted to confirm if this approach is correct?\nThe other approach I could think of was that I calculate the dDdc and d2Dd2c inside the .C files, but that will be too hectic, and there are no implementations like that that could be found.\nI could not find much about the coupled variables that were implemented that way I did, even when looking in different .i files.",
