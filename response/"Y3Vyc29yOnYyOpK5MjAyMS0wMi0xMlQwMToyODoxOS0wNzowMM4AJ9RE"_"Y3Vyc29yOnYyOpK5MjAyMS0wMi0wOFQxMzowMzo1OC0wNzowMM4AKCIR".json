Namely, in INSFVMomentumAdvection (and related kernels & BCs), the density is given by:\n/// Density\nconst Real & _rho;\nand is a required parameter:\nparams.addRequiredParam(\"rho\", \"The value for the density\");\nparams.declareControllable(\"rho\");\nand initialized by:\n_rho(getParam(\"rho\")),\nI can't think of a way to inherit from this and transform _rho to an ADMaterialProperty.

We made this choice to actually ensure that users didn't accidentally try to model a compressible problem with incompressible equations. If you actually want to model a compressible problem, I wouldn't recommend trying to work with the INSFV implementation; I would wait instead for the coming CNSFV/PCNSFV work or work off the gitlab fork I've shared with you if you want to get started now. I'm actually quite excited for the CNSFV work where we naturally have on-diagonals in the continuity equation and consequently don't have to use a Rhie-Chow interpolation for velocity in order to avoid the saddle-point problem and the accompanying checkerboard pattern in the pressure field.",

More a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none kind of guy \ud83d\ude04 So I, and others, are open to additional implementations and more importantly additional knowledge! Here is my understanding: if we wanted to go with a pressure-based approach to solving (some) (weakly) compressible flows, as opposed to a density-based approach, then what we would be doing fundamentally at a MOOSE implementation level is switching from using density as the nonlinear variable to using pressure as the nonlinear variable. If we do that, then we do indeed need Rhie-Chow again to combat the saddle-point nature of this implementation choice because we no longer have on-diagonals (without Rhie-Chow) in the mass continuity equation. Perhaps naively, this seems like an odd choice, but it must not be so odd because most people do it this way for low Mach number flows. But on the other hand most people are not doing fully coupled solves...but on the gripping hand (a @roystgnr catch-phrase) perhaps the segregated vs. fully-coupled distinction does not even matter. Perhaps I'm making much ado about nothing, and the pressure-based approach for low Mach number flows is truly the best choice even for fully-coupled solves. Anyway if we did elect to support a pressure-based approach to compressible flows, then we could indeed reuse much of the INSFV code. We would have to do some modifications to how we compute the Rhie-Chow interpolated velocity, however.",

Of course, that was finite volume with a staggered grid.  Over time, I have developed a marked preference for using primitive variables (P, V, T) rather than conservative ones.  A lot of that is based on the phase interaction terms.\nAlso, my application is for relatively low-speed flows but with density as fn(P, T).  I refer to that as \"weakly\" compressible.  It is much simpler than fully compressible (shock capturing etc).  So, for now, I will go ahead and work off of INSFV and try to make needed changes in my app.  For Rhie-Chow, I am guessing that the necessary changes are because del-dot-V is assumed zero.  Of course, that will require me to fully understand the implementation of Rhie-Chow.  Lots to learn.\nThanks again for the help,\nJoe K",

If you make the problem larger on your workstation you will likely see them appear as well. This feature was actually added for this reason. When you are running on HPC systems they tend to be a bit slower per processor and you also tend to run much larger problems. As such, we were having people think that a simulation was hung, but in truth it was just taking time. These displays give you some indication that your simulation is working.",

I can build them together on sawtooth so it must be something in my environment but I'm not sure what.  I've deleted my moose repo, blackbear repo and re-cloned them.  I'm using the standard moose conda environment using the instructions from the moose conda install help page. I brew uninstalled everything to make sure that wasn't causing the conflict and it wasn't because I still get the neml build error.  I think there is something in the blackbear/contrib/neml.mk that is causing this but I can't figure out what.  Has anyone seen this error and know how to fix it?\nIn file included from /Users/mundlb/projects/blackbear/contrib/neml/src/Block.h:3:\nIn file included from /Users/mundlb/projects/blackbear/contrib/neml/src/models.h:4:\nIn file included from /Users/mundlb/projects/blackbear/contrib/neml/src/objects.h:6:\nIn file included from /Users/mundlb/miniconda3/envs/moose-noLibmesh/bin/../include/c++/v1/vector:276:\n/Users/mundlb/miniconda3/envs/moose-noLibmesh/bin/../include/c++/v1/__bit_reference:172:38: error: no member named 'min' in namespace 'std::__1'\n        __storage_type __dn = _VSTD::min(__clz_f, __n);",

I followed the instructions at the link you posted but that doesn't solve the problem either.  I'm still picking up the wrong std libraries.

It looks like the neml header file objects.h is #including <algorithm> and my interpretation of the error I posted, it is trying to link to the libc++ version that has the __1 decoration, std::__1::min, but it cannot find this function in algorithms version that I have in my conda environment which is the libstdc++ version that is std::min function.",

So I would tell the maintainers of NEML to rename their header or change how NEML headers are meant to be included, e.g. #include \"neml/Block.h\".

Here is a test program:\n#include <iostream>\n#include <some_crazy_name_bar>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n  bar();\n  cout << \"Hello World!\\nI'm a C++ program\\n\";\n}\nand here is the directory containing it:\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ ls\na.out               hello.cpp           iostream            some_crazy_name_bar\n\niostream is some dummy file that that does not contain a definition of std::cout. some_crazy_name_bar is a file that defines the method void bar() {}. Here are some different compilation attempts:\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ clang++ -I. hello.cpp \nhello.cpp:4:17: warning: using directive refers to implicitly-defined namespace 'std'\nusing namespace std;\n                ^\nhello.cpp:8:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'cout'\n        cout << \"Hello World!\\nI'm a C++ program\\n\";\n        ^\n1 warning and 1 error generated.\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ clang++ hello.cpp\nhello.cpp:4:10: error: 'some_crazy_name_bar' file not found with <angled> include; use \"quotes\" instead\n#include <some_crazy_name_bar>\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n         \"some_crazy_name_bar\"\n1 error generated.\n\nAnd then following clang's suggestion to use quotes for including some_crazy_name_bar, the program compiles fine:\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ clang++ hello.cpp\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ ./a.out\nHello World!\nI'm a C++ program\n\nAnother compilation method that works fine:\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ clang++ -iquote. hello.cpp\n(moose-libmesh) lindad@localhost:~/programming/cpp/test-includes(master)$ ./a.out\nHello World!\nI'm a C++ program\n\nSo the key takeaways:\n\n-I<dir> adds <dir> to the search path for both quoted and angle-bracket included files. This is what destroys blackbears compilation of NEML because it does: -I${BLACKBEAR_DIR}/contrib/neml/src and consequently all of the headers in there become candidates for both quoted and angle-bracket includes. This is why when compiling blackbear we pick up the block.h header as a system header. When NEML is building itself it does not -I${BLACKBEAR_DIR}/contrib/neml/src and so it does fine\n-iquote<dir> adds <dir> only to the search path for quoted includes. This is what we are going to want to do for sustainable builds in MOOSE and Blacbear. I actually have to check and see whether this is an option for both gcc and clang. All the research I've done here for this discussion has been with clang.\n\nI am honestly kind of shocked we haven't run into an issue like this before",
