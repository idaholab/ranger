Adding a trace it is mentioned that it works by setting s=f(t,x) and f as the mass rate with unit kg/m2/s.\nNow my question is what is the density referring to? component or fluid or a fluid-component mixture? If it is a mixture, can we inject only components with component density or only fluid with fluid density?  For example, in the Porous Flow Tutorial Page 07. A chemically-reactive tracer, and porosity and permeability changes, only tracer_concentration is set by PorousFlowSink without porepressure.\n\n  [BCs]\n   [constant_injection_of_tracer]\n     type = PorousFlowSink\n     variable = tracer_concentration\n     flux_function = -5E-3\n     boundary = injection_area\n   []\n    [constant_outer_porepressure]\n     type = DirichletBC\n     variable = porepressure\n     value = 0\n     boundary = rmax\n   []\n []\n\n\nCompared to this PorousFlowSink, I remember when I use a point source with Dirackernel, it always creates some jumps with time at the source position, but this PorousFlowSink seems to give a very nice behavior without any jumps. What is the main reason resulting in that? Does PorousFLowSink only work at boundary terms?",

          "bodyText": "I am writing to inform you of my recent development of an AD constitutive material with applications in soil mechanics, specifically the CamClay model. After successfully testing this code in the C++ library Deal.II, I have decided to develop the AD version in MOOSE to add additional features without the need for derivatives and Jacobians.\nDespite attempting to fit the model into different subclasses of MOOSE to minimize manipulation, my first attempt using the ADGeneralizedRadialReturnMapping was unsuccessful due to its tie to the elasticity tensor, which conflicts with CamClay's unique elasticity tensor update. As a result, I have tried directly implementing the CamClay model as an ADStrainIncrementBasedStressUpdate. However, although I have successfully compiled the code, it does not converge for unknown reasons. I am particularly confused by the interdependencies of parameters, such as _stress[_qp], _incremental_strain[_qp], and others that must be provided.\nTo diagnose the issue, I have run several tests and have concluded that the problem occurs in the first step of the analysis before entering the plastic region. I suspect that the inconsistency of the initial stress and strain may be at fault. To elaborate, the CamClay model begins with an initial confining pressure (e.g., -100kPa) and then applies a deviatoric stress on top of a biaxial plain strain sample from the top.\nIf you have any recommendations or advice on how to resolve this issue or any potential oversights, please do not hesitate to let me know. I appreciate any help and am eager to resolve this issue as soon as possible.\nMahyar",
