Say I wanted to type a function:\nIF\n(condition1 OR condition2), action1,\nELSE\naction 2\nWould it be typed like:\nif ((condition1 or condition 2), action1, action2) ? What is used in MOOSE to denote and/or? I tried typing them out/using && || respectively and neither worked. Specifically, I have this line of code and it's throwing an error:\nexpression = 'if ( (x<((-gb_width/2)+(-z*tan(theta)))) || (x>((gb_width/2)+(z*tan(theta)))), k_bulk, k_gb)'\nAlso, to raise a value to a power, is it simply the \"^\" character? I looked through the examples on the parsed function page and saw the expressions actually typed out (e.g xxx instead of x^3), so I wanted to be sure.",

What you want to do is currently difficult to implement in a MoosePreconditioner class. Perhaps the easiest way would be to create your own class derived from FEProblem and override computeResidualTags and computeJacobianTags. You could add a parameter which is your postprocessor name. And then you could post scale your residuals and Jacobian/preconditioning matrices however you see fit, presumably after calling down to the base class:\nvoid\nCustomProblem::computeResidualTags(...)\n{\n  FEProblem::computeResidualTags(tags);\n  /* <do your postprocessor scaling here> */\n}\n\nvoid\nCustomProblem::computeJacobianTags(...)\n{\n  FEProblem::computeJacobianTags(tags);\n  /* <do your postprocessor scaling here> */\n}",

Since I see you have a PATH set to something generic looking into your home directory ~/.local/bin, but no corresponding LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to it. We can ignore this for now.\nI think the most important issue might be the fact you don't have any of the common CC, CXX, FC, etc variables set.

I tried getting the diagnostics log but I got permission denied. I will try and figure out how to get the diagnostics log.\n\nI'm also not sure if this is relevant, but for a different simulation which previously showed this same error, I fixed some of the input file and the error now shows that it is unable to load vector name 'SOLUTION STATE 2'.  I'm not sure how to fix this. I can start a new discussion for that if it doesn't really relate to this.\nThank you.\nWendy\n:/data2/jiw$ ldd ~/Software/blackbear/blackbear-opt\n        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe6cde1000)\n
