My eta1 kernels are AllenCahn and ACInterface and SwitchingFunctionConstraintEta and TimeDerivative.(Total 4)\nQues.1 Do I have to put these kernels again for eta2 or just SwitchingConstraintEta is enough ?\nQues.2 When I model using eta only and other phase as (1-eta) I get convergence using DerivativeTwoPhaseMaterial but when I am trying same problem using eta1 and eta2 separately with DerivativeMultiPhaseMaterial and MultiBarrierFunctionMaterial properties there is a convergence issue. Can we solve the same problem like the later approach?",

          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE Team,\nIn AbaqusUMATStress.C the ordering of the stress and strain seems to be different from the Abaqus convention:\nhttps://abaqus-docs.mit.edu/2017/English/SIMACAEMODRefMap/simamod-c-conventions.htm\nIn Abaqus the ordering of the stress vector is:\nsigma_{xx}, sigma_{yy}, sigma_{zz}, sigma_{xy}, sigma_{xz}, sigma_{yz}\nhowever, the way stress[qp] is assigned at line 283 of AbaqusUMATStress is different\nbecause the RankTwoTensor constructor follow another convention where sigma{yz} and  sigma{xy}\nare inverted.\nI was investigating this problem because of convergence issues I was facing when using the UMAT plugin.\nBasically the model converged well with one element but gave wrong results as soon as more elements were used.\nThis problem was reported by @edwardXZ06 some time ago:\n#19574\nbut I jumped too quickly to the conclusion that the timestepper was the problem.\nNow I tried changing line 174 with the strain components order:\n{{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 2}, {0, 1}, {0, 2},{1, 2} }};\nand the stress at line 284 to:\n_aqSTRESS[0], _aqSTRESS[1], _aqSTRESS[2], _aqSTRESS[5], _aqSTRESS[4], _aqSTRESS[3]);\nand all the convergence problems disappeared and I can get the same results as in Abaqus.\nOf course, if my UMAT is adapted one can use the current AbaqusUMATStress,\nhowever, I think the idea here is to provide compatibility between Abaqus UMAT and MOOSE,\ntherefore it would be better to follow Abaqus convention here.\nShould AbaqusUMATStress be changed? Can you please check?\nThank you\nBest Regards,\nNicol\u00f2",

It is a much quicker Conda package installer.\nAlso.... the inability to upgrade is probably due to the fact a python version in moose-tools is preventing it.
