For CONSTANT MONOMIAL variables like we use in THM's flow formulation, this might be possible, but for nodal variables, it wouldn't make since because nodes can be shared between subdomains.\nWhat is your objective in modifying the scaling factor from the default?",

I am trying to modify the scaling factor specifically for heated sections because the total heat generated from the source needs to be distributed between a given number of pipes; without the scaling, the average surface temperature of the pipes do not make sense for the problem I am simulating. Is there another way this could potentially be done in MOOSE? And what would be considered as a CONSTANT MONOMIAL variable - would there be specific components used for that?

To clarify, the scaling factor gets applied to the equations associated with that variable in the nonlinear system of equations, so in theory it should only affect\n\nconditioning of the linear system\nconvergence criteria\n\nSo it should have numerical effects only, not effects to the governing equations.\nIf you are trying to change terms in the equations, then this is done elsewhere (let me know if this is the case). If you are not trying to modify terms in the equations and you are seeing solution differences with different scaling factors, it is likely because you are inadvertently changing convergence criteria.\nSo you have a 2D heat structure, and you want to split the heat between flow channels?
