These scripts perform all the git submodule magic necessary.\nI think the only interaction a user will require to understand the intricacies involved with submodules, is when they are actively committing to MOOSE; asking for a newer version of PETSc, for example.\nI was going to convert this over to a discussion, but I am willing to leave it open as an issue, if we find that we should add submodule documentation that may be lacking elsewhere.

That should do the trick:\n./update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh --with-cuda=1\nIf you do this, and you are still wanting to use Conda packages, you should probably refrain from install the full gambit (don't install moose-dev). Instead, install what only is needed to build PETSc: conda create -n compilers_only moose-mpich.\n\nI am going to try to use conda to install moose\n\nBut even this is not recommended if you are operating on an HPC cluster. Your cluster will most certainly already have a much-better MPI wrapper, than what we provide with moose-mpich.",

However, it looks like your block structure has changed a bit after the latest tagged release, lets take the most basic example found here. It looks like [Modules/TensorMechanics/Master] has changed to [Physics/SolidMechanics/QuasiStatic] . However, this produces the error for me since I am not on next but  2024-02-12 tagged release. If I change that directive back to the [Modules/TensorMechanics/Master] the example runs fine.\nAm I missing something obvious about how to access old documentation online? I am currently building test_docs to create my local copy tied to the tagged release, so I think I should be fine, but it would still be good to know.",

          "bodyText": "Hi, everyone! I am a beginner for Moose. When I solve one element tension in 2D case, I find that the young's modules evaluated from the stress-strain curve calculated by Moose is different form that as the input material parameter. If the input young's modules is E0 and the Poisson's ratio is v0, the young's modulus calculated E seems to meet E=E0 /(1-v0^2).\nFor instance, I use the ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor material, e.g.\n [./elasticity_tensor]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = 210e3\n    poissons_ratio = 0.3\n  [../]\n\n\nThe input young's modulus is 210e3. But in the one 2D element tension experiment, the slope of stress-train curve is about  230e3. If I set the Poisson's ratio as 0, the slope of stress-train curve is about  210e3 correctly.\n\nI wonder why the Poisson's ratio has an effect on the stress-strain curve of the one element tension in 2D case? The default 2D plane problem in Moose is plane stress or plane strain? And How could I set it?",
