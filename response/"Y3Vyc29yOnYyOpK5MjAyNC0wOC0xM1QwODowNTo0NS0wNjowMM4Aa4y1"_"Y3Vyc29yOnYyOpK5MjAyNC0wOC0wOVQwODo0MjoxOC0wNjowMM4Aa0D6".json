ENABLED:\n This application uses the legacy initial residual evaluation behavior. The legacy behavior performs an often times redundant residual evaluation before the solution modifying objects are executed prior to the initial (0th nonlinear iteration) residual evaluation. The new behavior skips that redundant residual evaluation unless the parameter Executioner/use_pre_smo_residual is set to true. To remove this message and enable the new behavior, set the parameter 'use_legacy_initial_residual_evaluation_behavior' to false in *App.C. Some tests that rely on the side effects of the legacy behavior may fail/diff and should be re-golded.\n\nc\nTime Step 0, time = 0\n \nTime Step 1, time = 0.05, dt = 0.05\n\nThread 1 \"shale-dbg\"

Is there any way to speed up this process? My PC specs are decent: a parallel Xeon processor with 20 CPUs and 128GB RAM. I have installed MOOSE manually, compiling libmesh, PETSc, and WASP myself.\n\n\nBy default, the MOOSE application is launched in the VSCode debugger with 4 threads. Is there a way to configure it to launch with only 1 thread? I have tried the option of -n-threads=1 still MOOSE is lauched with 4 threads.\n\n\nThank you for considering my queries. I look forward to your response.",

                  "bodyText": "Hello,\nI understand your concerns regarding the debugging process with MOOSE in VSCode on Ubuntu. Let me try to address your queries:\n\n\nSlow launch time for debugging:\n\nThe launch time for a MOOSE application can be influenced by several factors, such as the complexity of the input file, the size of the simulation, and the overall system performance.\nSince you have a powerful machine with a Xeon processor and 128GB of RAM, the launch time should be relatively faster. However, there are a few things you can try to potentially improve the startup time:\n\nEnsure that you have the latest version of VSCode and the necessary extensions installed (e.g., C/C++ extension).\nCheck if you have any other processes or applications running in the background that might be consuming system resources.\nConsider profiling your MOOSE application to identify any potential performance bottlenecks.\nConsult the MOOSE documentation or the MOOSE community forum for any specific recommendations or troubleshooting steps related to debugging performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the number of threads:\n\nThe MOOSE framework is designed to take advantage of multi-threading to improve performance. By default, it will launch the application with the maximum number of available threads on your system.\nTo configure the number of threads, you can use the --n-threads or -n command-line argument when launching your MOOSE application. For example, to run with a single thread, you can use the following in your launch.json file:\n\"programArgs\": \"-i examples/bcc_FeCr/test1p5/bcc_pxtal.i --n-threads=1\"\n\n\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to the desired number of threads before launching the MOOSE application. For example:\n\"env\": {\n    \"OMP_NUM_THREADS\": \"1\"\n}\n\n\nKeep in mind that running with fewer threads may not necessarily improve performance, as it depends on the specific problem and the parallelization capabilities of your MOOSE application.\n\n\n\nI hope these suggestions help you address the issues you're facing with debugging your MOOSE application in VSCode. If you continue to experience problems, don't hesitate to reach out to the MOOSE community or the MOOSE development team for further assistance.",

How can I specify the use of a displaced mesh in this updated syntax? Is it enabled by default, or is there another method to achieve this?\nThank you for your assistance.",

Try reducing the time step and see if it can avoid the unconverged steps. For the crystal plasticity model, my experience is that aiming for 0.01% strain increase, or less, for each time step will lead to good convergence. It depends on the constitutive model though. As @GiudGiud  says, regular unconverged steps will lead to a very slow simulation overall.",
