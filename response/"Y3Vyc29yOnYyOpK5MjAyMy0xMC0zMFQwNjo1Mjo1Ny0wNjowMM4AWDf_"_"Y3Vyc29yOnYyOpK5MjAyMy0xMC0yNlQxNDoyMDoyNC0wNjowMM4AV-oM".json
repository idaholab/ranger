Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.\nAvailable platform plugins are: eglfs, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, webgl, xcb.\n\nWhen I try this:\n../darcy_thermo_mech-opt -i step1.i\nEverything is fine, it returns 'Solve Converged!'\nThe xeyes works well, and I also enabled the ''Disable access control'' when using VcXsrv, so I'm not sure what's going on :(\nDoes anyone have a similar experience?",

This updates well as the elements move. However, I would like the elements that are activated to move into a different subdomain to the grey one as it will have different properties.\nIn scenario 2 (see image), I have started off with some elements already in the red domain, and elements move from the blue to the red. The complement_moving_boundary does update to account for the new red domain, but the part of it previously between the red and grey is not removed.\nI was wondering how I could set the parameters so the complement_moving_boundary doesn't keep parts that are between the red and grey? I am also block restricting my variables to the red and grey domains.\n\nThank you.\nWendy",

          "bodyText": "Hello, I am currently working on ActivateElementByPath related work, I am wondering that whether the variable for new activate element  could be specified in the userobject, for example, a pure thermal problem, the element id is transferred from 0 to 1, then could the temperature be also transferred to a specified value as initial condition of this element in the UserObject block instead of defining it in the ics? If I would like to implement this, is there any existing code or what kind of code should I modify or add to the source file?",

You just need to modify the user object to set the value of the variable after creating the element.\nor more likely a second user object that acts after the system has been re-sized and sets the value of the variable based on some other variable that distinguishes a new element from an old one (like some sort of boolean field)",
