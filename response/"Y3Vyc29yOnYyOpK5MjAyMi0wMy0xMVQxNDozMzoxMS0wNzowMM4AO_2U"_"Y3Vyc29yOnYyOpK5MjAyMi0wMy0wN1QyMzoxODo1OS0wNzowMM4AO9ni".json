I found many examples for a damage as a function of (x, y, t) and its influence on stresses but couldn't find (most likely missed) an example that would help me in my application.\nI tried to have damage as a new material variable and access the von Mises stress to compute it. However, I run into an error when I want to multiply the stress to a value because it is a tensor... While I think it should, in theory, simply be a scalar?\nFiles needed to replicate this error are available here.\nerror: cannot convert 'libMesh::boostcopy::enable_if_c<true, libMesh::TypeTensor<double> >::type' {aka 'libMesh::TypeTensor<double>'} to 'libMesh::Real' {aka 'double'} in initialization\n   49 |   Real Xi = _alpha * _von_mises;\n      |             ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~\n      |                    |\n      |                    libMesh::boostcopy::enable_if_c<true, libMesh::TypeTensor<double> >::type {aka libMesh::TypeTensor<double>}\n\nI think I am probably already wrong in my strategy. Damage should probably be an auxiliary variable and not a material one. I took that decision as I would like to have the material viscosity to depend on the damage in the case of viscous deformation in the future. What do you think?\nAny help and/or advice would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot!",

You are coupling to a variable that provides a scalar, but to access the value of that at your quadrature point, you'd need to index into it like this: _von_mises[_qp].\nHowever, that isn't really the best way to get at the von Mises stress, because you're extracting that from the stress tensors at the quadrature points, and then converting that to a field variable, so you're losing information. It would be better to extract it directly as a scalar material property at your quadrature point, and then use that material property containing the von Mises stress in your damage model.

Yes, I would like to apply a single BCs kernel that contains multiple heat transfer phenomena contributions e.g. convective + radiation, and/or the option to add more such as beam power. However, I only found independent BCs kernels for the radiation and convection.\nMay I also ask if there's a way to couple Thermo-Calc databases into MOOSE in order to retrieve temperature-dependent material properties, thermodynamic and mobility data  into the Heat Conduction and/or Phase-field modules?\nSecond question, is there a way to also account for phase transformations within the Heat Conduction module?\n@shuine-09 thank you for your suggestion, I was not aware about this Material kernel. I just recently started to explore the in-built heat conduction kernels in MOOSE before aiming to create alternative kernels.

The left and back are fixed. The program can be successfully performed. But the output of stress and strain are zero. Could you share any thoughts or suggestions with me to solve it?",

I think it is important if I want to check the value of the variable.\nSome variables are defined by vector (e.g. _slip_increment). How can I display the content of this vector using lldb? What I did was to specify one, for example, _slip_increment[_qp][1], and then print out one by one. Do you have good advice?\nI can only print out global variables but have no idea how to display the local variables defined in a function.\n\nThank you.",

Instead, I usually have a bunch of old fashioned std::cout <<  statements all over my code, and I try to have these print statements for each qp and each slip system.\n\nMaybe @dewenyushu or @dschwen have some suggestions on setting breakpoints for looking at the values of variables\nWhen I print out the value of variables with std::cout I try to be inside of a loop over the slip systems to use the loop to index the vector. For example, in the calculateSlipRate method of CrystalPlasticityTwinningKalidindiUpdate, I used the following to print out the value of the slip increment, lines 150-164 plus a few extra print statements:\n\nfor (const auto i : make_range(_number_slip_systems))\n    total_twin_volume_fraction += _twin_volume_fraction[_qp][i];\n\n  if (total_twin_volume_fraction < _limit_twin_volume_fraction)\n  {\n    for (const auto i : make_range(_number_slip_systems))\n    {\n      if (_tau[_qp][i] > 0.0)\n      {\n        const Real driving_force = (_tau[_qp][i] / _slip_resistance[_qp][i]);\n        _slip_increment[_qp][i] = std::pow(driving_force, (1.0 / _rate_sensitivity_exponent)) *\n                                  _reference_strain_rate * _substep_dt;\n      }\n      else // twin propagation is directional\n        _slip_increment[_qp][i] = 0.0;\n\n   std::cout << \" On qp \" << _qp << \" and twin system number \" << i << \":\\n\";\n   std::cout << \"   the value of the slip increment is \" << _slip_increment[_qp][i] << \"\\n\";\n\nAt least this way you don't have to explicitly call each entry in the vector (which could be a large pain if you have the 24 or 48 slip systems!)\n3. Using the unsophisticated std::cout method listed above will also work for local variables!\nGood luck!",
