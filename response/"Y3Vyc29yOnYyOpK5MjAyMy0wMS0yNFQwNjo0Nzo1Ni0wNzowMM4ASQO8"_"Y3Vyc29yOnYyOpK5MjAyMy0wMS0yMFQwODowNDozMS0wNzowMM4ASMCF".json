          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nJust noted that a PorousFlow simulation using MethaneFluidProperties from the Fluid Properties module was having a negative specific enthalpy, and wondered if that is right. So, I've obtained some tabulated fluid properties for methane and compared those with those obtained by CoolProp [both cite Setzmann and Wagner (1991) as reference]. Both enthalpy and internal energy differ wildly from those obtained from CoolProp [right column here]:\n\nAlso viscosity [although with different references] is rather different and strangely non-dependent on pressure within FluidProperties:\n\nI've tested another gas (hydrogen) as example, and the EOS give similar results in both codes. This is absolutely not a priority for me. Just wanted to report in case it is useful...",

But I think this is fine according to some examples? Although I guess that to be more exact I should have included 'mass_fraction_component=0' to refer only to water in the liquid phase, right?\nIn any case, it seems to me that the lack of convergence is not related to the top boundary conditions, but more to the initiation of the gas phase (as the single-phase initial part of the runs well) on the lateral injection sideset.",

I reduced your problem a bit to make it faster and was able to get it to run. The key change is to make a second capillary pressure user object where the capillary pressure is constant (so the derivatives wrt saturation are zero) and pass that to the PorousFlowFluidState material. (Note: the value of Pc isn't used in this material, only the derivatives wrt saturation are, so it doesn't change the residual, only the jacobian).\nAlso, I reduced nl_max_its in the Executioner so that the timestep will cut back sooner when a gas phase appears just to make it faster. I get something that looks right - the methane enters the mesh, moves upwards quickly until it reaches the cap, starts to accumulate here until it continues upwards.",

This is a pre-stressed that existed on the system even before the battery operation started.\nI am thinking of adding this as an eigen strain (by converting the stress in terms of strain using a compliance tensor). In the code, sigma_o is that strain. I wanted to apply this in the y-direction. Thats why I put eigen_base = '0.0 1.0 0.0'. However, seems like i am doing something wrong - prefactor is not effecting the eigenstrain for some reason\nAlso, how can I add an equation for sigma_o rather than a constant value?

I would also try running without coupled mechanics to make sure it converges without the mechanics part first.\nFor the question about the prefactor not working as you are expecting, I'm not sure what you mean by not affecting the eigenstrain_b. Do you mean that it is not affecting microstructural evolution? The reason I suggested outputting eigenstrain_b to the Exodus file is so that you can visualize it and make sure it is non-zero. If it is zero everyone then you would know there was a problem with your prefactor material property.

I am modeling nanoindentation and I will occasionally see a negative Jacobian error as my tip is pressed into the material. I have tuned my contact parameters to a point where there is nearly 0 visible distortion under the tip, however, I am still getting this negative Jacobian in some simulations. Here is a picture of my material surface:\n\nWithin my material the mesh is updated each time step. The elements MOOSE creates when updating the mesh are sometimes very small splinters. In the picture below, I focus on a region which has the element that caused the error.\n\nIs there any parameters that I can use to control when and how MOOSE updates the mesh elements? Should I continue to tune my contact module parameters to a point where this is 0 visual surface deformation? I have run this simulation many times and this problem only arises with some meshes, even though they have all been prepared very similarly.

I would imagine that if you load this very carefully and use all the best formulation and solver options, you can probably get pretty far (which you already have done), but at a certain point, the distortion in those elements right at the tip will be so high that they will be very close to inverting. One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet which might be helpful is the ElementJacobianDamper.

                          "bodyText": "@Vandenbg - since you mention needing to scale your mesh in Cubit I thought I might add some commentary.  The CAD kernel used by Cubit is ACIS which, like other BREP-based CAD kernels, uses absolute tolerances.  The default absolute tolerance for Cubit is 1E-06 - you can set the accuracy via set geometry accuracy <double> where the tolerance is limited to the range: 10.0 <-> 1E-06.\nWhat we recommend for users is to scale their geometry so that the smallest BREP feature length is ~1.0, though for most \"normal engineering\" problems (i.e., those that come from their company's CAD/PLM system) it's not strictly necessary.  But for many \"physics engineering\" problems it is often necessary.  In these cases I usually scale my geometry by the nearest power of 10 for simplicity.  Then after you've built your mesh on the scaled model you can tell the exporter to apply a scale factor when exporting the mesh (documentation here):\ntransform mesh output scale <factor>\n\nNote that transform commands are cumulative, added to the effect of previous transforms. To clear a transformation matrix, use the reset option:\ntransform mesh output reset\n\nMesh input and output transformations are also cleared when you reset the entire model using the reset command.\nAn example script template might look like:\nreset\n## Import geometry and scale\nimport stp \"nanoindenter.stp\" noheal\n#{scale_factor = 1e3}\nvolume all scale {scale_factor}\ntransform mesh output {1/scale_factor}\n## Mesh\nwebcut vol all xplane \nwebcut vol all yplane \nimprint all\nmerge all\nmesh vol all\n## Export\nset exodus netcdf4 off\nset large exodus file on\nexport mesh \"nanoindenter.e\"  overwrite \ntransform mesh output reset",

Is it important to scale on the output instead of scaling in my journal file?\n\nIt is different because volume all scale <factor> scales the underlying BREP data, which \"owns\" the mesh entities.  It's thus possible to corrupt the BREP, which in turn corrupts the mesh attached to it.  It doesn't necessarily always happen, but the difference with using transform mesh is that it simply applies the scale factor using double-precision operations applied to the nodal coordinates.  Because it doesn't interact with the BREP, there's zero risk of a corrupt BREP messing up your mesh.",
