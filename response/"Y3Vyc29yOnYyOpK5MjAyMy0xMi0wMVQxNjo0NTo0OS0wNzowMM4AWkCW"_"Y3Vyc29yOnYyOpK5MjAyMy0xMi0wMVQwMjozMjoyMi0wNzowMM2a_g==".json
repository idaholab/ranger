          "bodyText": "I need some help and advice on how to create efficient meshes in 2D and 3D, if possible using the built-in MOOSE meshing tools.  (But if there's an easy-to-learn alternative which I can use to create a mesh file which I then pull in to my MOOSE input file that could work too.)\nI've really only worked in 1D with MOOSE before, almost exclusively using GeneratedMeshGenerator with combinations of regular and biased meshes.\nBut now I need 2D and 3D models initially for squares and cubes (or at least a quadrant of a square and an octant of a cube assuming symmetry at mid-point lines and planes).  GeneratedMeshGenerator explicitly says it can do this and I can produce a simple squares, rectangles or cubiod boxes.  But I want to be able to model concentric squares within squares and boxes within boxes for different mesh blocks and materials.  These would have finer or biased meshes close to the interfaces between layers.  I can't see a quick way to do this with GeneratedMeshGenerator as I would have to stitch together a fairly complicated arrangement of rectangles or cuboids.\nAnd another probably more important challenge is that a 1D model with 1000 elements (and solves quite quickly) when extended to be the same in 2D and 3D gives 10^6 and 10^9 elements respectively.  This makes solving really slow (especially for 3D) and seems very inefficient as the elements could be much coarser further from the centre (similar to a cylindrical or spherical radial mesh).  So I think I need to try some alternative elements types, but again have no experience doing this having just used GeneratedMeshGenerator in 1D with default settings.\nAny tips or suggestions on what mesh types and tools I could start using to do this?  Any examples of this type of mesh which others have built?  Is there a useful tutorial or video anywhere?\nThanks in advance for any help!",

The mesh wont be conformal anymore, but it's in a way that is supported by MOOSE/libmesh (h-refinement)\nGuillaume",

But I couldn't find how to do so...\nThe end goal is to implement a Coulomb model at the interface between the viscous material and a rock base, at the bottom of my current mesh. But maybe there is actually a better way to do it from the beginning than changing subdomain IDs?\nSo far I've only found solutions for a friction law between two media that are directly described in the input mesh.\nThank you a lot in advance for your help!",

If we have 1 q-point it is appropriate solution.\nBut to implement beam model based on Euler-Bernoulli theory, where shear deformations are neglected, the second derivative of rotation is needed to calculate shear forces Q =  EI\u03b8\".\nSo i need to use Hermite shape functions. And then, in computeQpStrain() instead of existing gradient calculation with linear shape function for transverse displacements and rotations:\n\nI will to define third order Hermite shape function manually, to retrieve q-point values, and also first and second derivatives\n\nIs there a more appropriate way to obtain second derivatives for this case, than manual processing of shape function.",

The geometry (nodes, elements, ...) is currently prepared outside of Moose in a GMSH file and this GMSH file is then imported into Moose using the FileMeshGenerator.\nProperties etc. are assigned to the blocks in various commands in the Moose input file. To avoid having to do this individually for each block, I use variables that contain lists of block names.\nI would like to maintain these lists outside of the Moose input file.\nQuestion 1: Can additional lists of blocks be transferred to the Moose in a GMSH file? The assignment of several \"PhysicalNames\" per block is rejected with an error during import in Moose.\nQuestion 2: Can, for example, a list of block names from a JSON file be read into a Moose variable using JSONFileReader and then used? I haven't found anything about this in my search so far.\nQuestion 3: Of course I can also have block lists written (automatically) to an *.i file and load this via \"!import\". Unfortunately, I get a message if I do not use all variables. Basically, I think this behaviour of warning of unused variables is very good. But how can I suppress the message for specific variables that they are not used?",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI have a question about properly setting outlet boundary conditions in the INS module when the 'INSADGravityForce' kernel is being used.\nWhen gravity is enabled, there is naturally a pressure gradient throughout the fluid domain. Setting a constant pressure at the outlet results in back-flow, which is expected due to the pressure difference inside the fluid domain at the top and bottom of the outlet.\nTo avoid this problem, we can instead account for the hydrostatic pressure at the outlet by setting p = p_0 + rho*g*(h-h_ref), where p is the fixed pressure at the outlet, p_0 is the pressure you would specify if gravity wasn't included, rho is the fluid density, g is gravity, and (h-h_ref) is the distance to some reference height.\nIf we consider the simple case where h_ref = 0, p_0 = 0, and gravity acts in the negative y direction, this becomes p = rho*g*y. We can also initialise the pressure in the fluid domain to be rho*g*y.\nHowever, when I do this, I see immediate pressure oscillations in space at the outlet which eventually prevent the simulation from converging. I am using PSPG stabilisation without which the oscillations are much worse.\nI have also tried using a finer mesh, as well as setting the inlet velocity to zero, Neither of these changes the behaviour at the outlet.\nAm I treating this boundary correctly, and is there anything else I can try to prevent these pressure oscillations?\nThanks!\n(Below are two images, one showing the initialised domain, and the other showing the first time step. The inlet is a constant velocity inlet at the bottom left, and the pressure outlet is as described in the top right.

However, I checked the beam element in moose, it uses the Lagrange interpolation for both displacements and rotations, as shown in the following:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/tensor_mechanics/beam_vandv.html\nWhy is the beam element different from the commonly used beam element? Is there a reference for this beam element?\nIs there an element in moose with Hermite interpolation?\nThank you very much!\nBest wishes,\nXiandong",
