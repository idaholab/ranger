We track pretty closely with libMesh, so there is a danger of straying too far in version and having failures, but for development purposes you can build your own libmesh and set the LIBMESH_DIR environment variable to tell MOOSE where it's located. If you aren't doing active libmesh development, you should consider remaining with the submodule version supplied with MOOSE.",

I want to solve a hyperelastic model with no plasticity and the incremental form (hypo-elastic) will cause inaccuracies for large strains.  I'm writing this post to discuss the changes in the code I have to make in order to include hyper-elasticity with a total strain formulation.\nSome initial thoughts/steps:\n\nThe properties _total_strain and _mechanical_strain will be defined in class that inherits from \"ComputeStrainBase\".\nModifying TensorMechanicsAction(Base) to call the above function if StrainAndIncrement::FiniteTotal.\nThe Finite Strain Hyperelastic stress will be calculated in a function which inherits from \"ComputeStressBase\".\n\nAfter making these changes, I was able to solve some numerical examples but the jacobian was not correct (I used -snes_test_jacobian in a transient problem for comparison). I pushed forward my jacobian because the stress divergence kernel is expressed in the current configuration. I'm not sure if I have to make any changes in the solvers (nonlinear).\nI look forward to hearing your feedback/ideas about this topic.\nThanks,\nLabros",

So its less a technical question about specific details of the install and more a broader question about whether the approach I'm trying makes sense given the way moose is used, and if not, what do other people do in this situation.\nI've worked though the \"Multi-User Cluster Instructions\" here https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/cluster.html but they kind of peter out before they get to the point I'm having problems with\nSo broadly the idea is that we have installations of moose that are snapshots in time, so they are not updated with git, if we want an up to date install we create a new dated installation to sit alongside the existing.\nAnd each installation of moose should be useable by different people for different projects.\nWe're not using conda - a quick over view of the install is\ninstall gcc9.2 / mpich / cmake (shared between all the installations of moose)\ngit clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose.git into a shared location\n./scripts/update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh\n./scripts/update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh\ncd test && make -j8\nNow originally when we decided on this approach it was thought that building a project against moose didn't alter the moose directory itself.  However I've realised now that the moose installation does get altered which calls into question this strategy.\nSo now I'm thinking each group / project will need to have its own moose directory?  Is that the way the way people typically work?  Is it possible to have moose installed in a way that people build different projects agains a single install of moose?  And if not what do people typically do instead in HPC / multi-user environment.\nThanks",

This is why we recommend each individual user maintain their own copy of MOOSE.\nThere are some things you can share. PETSc, and libMesh. However, I would recommend against it, as that will put great strain on the system admin (if that is you); Adding new iterations of these two libraries and keeping them in sync with every iteration of MOOSE your end users are wanting to develop against. This creates many iterations in the long run. This was the reason we introduced the two scripts: update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh; update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh. They are designed to be executed by the end user (easily).\nThe bottom line, as a developer that developer will need write access to the framework (MOOSE repository).\nIf you have end users wanting to instead execute a MOOSE based app, that is very much sharable.

The problem is defined below\n\nThis problem is very straight forward and using the method of characteristics has an analytic solution. I am trying to use the mms system to show verification with more complex reaction-convection problems but started with something simple. I have initially chosen this problem because it has an analytic solution that i can test the FEM solution against to show convergence. For this same problem I am also using the mms system to show convergence in space and time.\nUsing the simple test function of u = t^3 * x I can get good temporal convergence rates for my mms runs and they agree with the temporal convergence rates for my analytical solution. Spatial convergence is what i am having trouble understanding. Using the analytical solution and a mms I conducted a spatial convergence study for three error metrics show below.\n\n\nFor convection I am using LevelSetAdvection and LevelSetAdvectionSUPG. Looking at the LevelSet module, they have a mms test case where they show second order convergence on the default Lagrange mesh with a similar PDE but with out the decay source term. I am guessing that because i am doing a more complex PDE it will not show a higher rate of convergence against either mms or the true analytical solution? Another question I have is why the convergence rates using mms and analytical don't match up more? Now they do both follow the same general trend however I am very new to using mms and just want to make sure that what I am seeing is ok. The analytical solution is more simple than my assumed mms, not sure how much that changes the convergence rates.  I don't think the LevelSet module us the AD method for the jacobian and not sure if i should be overwriting the class and add new derivatives to the jacobian calculation.\nIn summary I have two questions. Should this problem be converging at a fast rate? Why is the convergence rate for mms slightly worse than testing convergence with the analytical solution?\nI have adjusted the time step sizes to make sure that they are low enough for this problem.

It seems like it might have something to do with the return value of ADRealVectorValue. I wondering if it might be useful to rewrite these LevelSetSUGP classes using the ADKernelStabilizedTempl base class which has an virtual function computeQpStabilization() method which has a return type of ADRealVectorValue.",

For your case, you probably need to implement a new SUPG kernel for the decay term.\nThe LevelSetForcingFunctionSUPG implements the weak form given as -tau * velocity * grad_test * f. If we use ADKernelGrad, then we only need to provide  (-tau * velocity * f)  to precomputeQpResidual.\nIt seems to be possible to write LevelSetSUPG using ADKernelStablized, although I do not see any obvious advantage there. ADKernelStablized was used for shallow water equation before. Maybe @aeslaughter would know this better than me.",
