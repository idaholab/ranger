          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI've recently been using stochastic tools in conjunction with Griffin for providing sensitivity and uncertainty quantification, as well as attempting to develop a surrogate, for a nuclear thermal propulsion project. I've had some success, but I've consistently encountered issues on Sawtooth with simulation initializations, during solves, and at the solve completion. I get hanging jobs frequently, and these are relatively intensive (60 node) jobs. If there is any advice out there, I'd appreciate it. Here are the modules I've been using on sawtooth, loading use.moose and moose-dev:\n  1) use.moose                     4) curl/7.61.1-gcc-12.3.0-5t73   7) cmake/3.27.7-gcc-12.3.0-5cfk  10) mpfr/4.2.0-gcc-10.5.0-cec4  13) gcc/12.3.0-gcc-10.5.0-vx2f   16) moose-dev/2023-10-23\n  2) flex/2.6.4-gcc-12.3.0-cnsv    5) ncurses/6.1-gcc-12.3.0-7zps   8) patchelf/0.18.0               11) mpc/1.3.1-gcc-10.5.0-mpcb   14) mvapich2/2.3.7-1-gcc-12.3.0\n  3) bison/3.0.4-gcc-12.3.0-547w   6) zlib/1.2.13-gcc-12.3.0-c2ww   9) gmp/6.1.2-gcc-10.5.0-wep3     12) zstd/1.4.4-gcc-10.5.0-yue3  15) moose-tools/2023-10-19\n\nHere are a couple examples of the hanging jobs.

In GrainBoundaryVelocity Auxkernel (https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/modules/phase_field/src/auxkernels/GrainBoundaryVelocity.C)\nThe class\nGrainBoundaryVelocity::computeValue()\ncalculates velocity as _new_val. My question is is the _new_val same as the screenshot?",

Firstly, I'm so sorry that my improper operation has had a negative impact on your and the users' work. After reinstalling gcc10.4.0 \u3001mpich4.2.0\u3001PETSc\u3001libmesh, I have solved the problem I encountered earlier. Therefore, I think maybe it is necessary for you to inform users of the requirements for GCC in different versions. For example, when I was using the latest version, if you want to make in /test/ file, it required a language requirement of c++17, which forced me to reinstall GCC versions higher than 8.0.\nJiahuilv",
