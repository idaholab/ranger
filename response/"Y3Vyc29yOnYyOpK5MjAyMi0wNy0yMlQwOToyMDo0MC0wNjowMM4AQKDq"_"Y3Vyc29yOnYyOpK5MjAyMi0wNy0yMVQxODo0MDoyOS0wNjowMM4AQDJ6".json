          "bodyText": "Hi,\nAt first, I have some questions about the preconditioner and linear solver.\n\n\nIn some simple problems, we can use LU/iLU and ksp gmres/bcgs to solve linear equations. Unfortunately, LU could not solve complex problems due to expensive resource consumption, especially with more than 100000 DOFs. Therefore we must use other preconditioners such as asm or bjacobi to solve linear equations. Frustratingly, it often happens that the system of linear equations does not converge so that the whole problem cannot be solved. But I found that we can change some options such as -sub_pc_factor_levels and -pc_factor_shift_type to help solve linear equations. Are there any descriptions of these options like -sub_pc_factor_levels on any website?\n\n\nI am always confused by diverged problems such as DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN and DIVERGED_LINEAR_SEARCH, etc.  Are there any descriptions of these diverged problems like DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN and DIVERGED_LINEAR_SEARCH, etc on any website?\n\n\nBesides, I have some questions about the nonlinear solver.\n\n\nMOOSE's default nonlinear solve method is PJFNK. In my opinion, if the jacobian matrix is could be made by hand or automatic difference, the NEWTON method is more effective and fast to solve the FEM problems. I'm not sure I'm right about the opinion.\n\n\nIn nonlinear solve progress, Is linear_search necessary? Are there any descriptions of these line_search methods on any website?\n\n\nThanks.",

You may look at their documentation. They generally mean the nonlinear solver is failing, which either means there's a bug in the Jacobian or better initialization would help.\nYou should check the Jacobian with the Jacobian analyzer\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/development/analyze_jacobian.html\nNonlinear solver:\n1)\nSee this documentation\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/source/systems/NonlinearSystem.html\nSince we often use the Jacobian for the preconditioning in PJFNK, the memory consumption is similar to Newton's. But if we did not, the memory consumption would be much smaller for PJFNK than Newton's, hence the default.\n\n\n\nAll we have on line searches are this page. The petsc manual is a better reference since we're just importing a petsc tool here\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/LineSearches/\nI turn off the line search for ALL my modeling.

Here's how I did it.\n\nIf this method is used, the outlet must be given a advection boundary condition. Unfortunately, I found this method to be less robust than the current method. And I think that's probably why by default MOOSE don't integrate by parts for advection terms.\nTherefore I'm wondering whether there are other robust methods to achieve no penetration BC on MOOSE.\nLooking forward toyour reply.

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI meet a poroelastic problem of coupled natural convection (TH) and poroelastic mechanics (HM).\nThis benchmark is simplified based on this work using Comsol (https://www.essoar.org/pdfjs/10.1002/essoar.10508352.1).\nProblem information:\nAim: To study the effect of the mechanic (M) on the buoyancy-driven convection (TH)\nGeometry: x and y is (0, 5500) m; z is (-5500, 0) m; Fig. 1.\nBlocks: basement (impermeable) and fault (permeable)\nBCs: (1) Top surface: fixed 293.15 K temperature and 10^5 Pa porepressure; (2) Bottom surface: NeummannBC of temperature is 0.1 W/m^2, disp_x,y,z =0;\nICs: (1) temperature: '293.15-z0.03' ; (2) porepressure: '100000-10009.81*z'\nEOS: same to the above paper. Water density is the function of temperature and porepressure. Water viscosity is the function of temperature.\npermeability and porosity evolution: no.\nautomatic_scaling = true\nCouplings: TH (i.e. buoyancy-driven convection) and HM (i.e. poroelastic) couplings. No thermal expansion and volume expansion.\nForces: only body force (gravity).\nOther detailed properties are shown in input files.\nMy work:\n\nbuoyancy-driven convection (TH).\n\nThe result is Ok.\n\nHM poroelastic mechanics\n\nI test some examples from (https://github.com/ajacquey/golem/tree/master/test/tests/HM). The result is also fine.\n\ncoupling of buoyancy-driven convection (TH) and poroelastic mechanics (HM)\n\n(1) Steady simulation;\nkernels:\n\npure heat conduction (T kernel)\npure porepressure diffusion (H)\nbody force kernel (my app)\nPoroMechanicsCoupling\nTensor Mechanics Master Action System (M kernels).\nEOS: constant water density 1000 (kg/m3)and viscosity (1e-3 Pa.s).\n\n(2) Transient simulation:\n\nthe kernels in steady simulation\ntransient temperature and pore pressure kernels\nHM coupling kernel (my app, _biot[_qp] * _vol_strain_rate[_qp] * _test[_i][_qp])\n\na. It uses the output results (temperature, pore pressure, displacements (using or ignoring)) of steady simulation as the initial values of Transient simulation.\nb. Moreover, I learn the examples about setting 'ComputeEigenstrainFromInitialStress' (regarding body force as initial stress) from https://github.com/idaholab/falcon/blob/devel/test/tests/THM_injection/thm_steady.i and https://groups.google.com/g/moose-users/c/ceMFbx9CgiE. To be honest, I am not sure whether should I regarding body force as initial stress.\nc. The application of the stresses is applied progressively by setting the body gravity increases from 0.01 to 9.81 in 10 years.\nHowever, all my previous Transient simulations output very terrible convergence information (as follows) even at first time step t=1s.\nMy request: Could you please give me some tips on my problem?

Eg, it's quite easy to accidentally create a model which is trying to extract \"stuff\" (fluid, heat, etc) from a boundary when there actually isn't any \"stuff\" there to extract.  In that case MOOSE (and any decent numerical solver) will not converge because there truly isn't any solution.",

Let's say we look at the equation in the OP, there is no transient term, no artificial viscosity, no diffusion, no stabilization -- just advection and a constant source. Isn't the matrix singular?",
