We update the software many times a day, and when testing passes for a change in MOOSE, we update many of the MOOSE-based applications on the same day once their tests pass with the changes to MOOSE. This allows us to get updates to applications as soon as possible, whether it be bug fixes or new features.\nThe master branch of BISON has its MOOSE submodule updated once all of its own tests pass with the new changes to MOOSE. With this, you can grab any commit of BISON, and have a version of MOOSE (noted within the submodule) that is guaranteed to be compatible.\nThis is why you will see the MOOSE submodule within BISON (and many other MOOSE-based applications) change quite a bit: we update BISON as soon as reasonably possible with newer versions (more recent commits) of MOOSE.\nBottom line: whenever you update an application, be sure to update the MOOSE submodule if it has one!",

It is due to commits that were in an older submodule of MOOSE are NOT found (the sha's are not shown) in the git log of the submodule in a NEWER version. Say we checkout a version of the BISON with a submodule of moose an update to the version of moose packaged with that version of the downstream app. Now lets say we take a version of BISON 3 days later and update to the moose submodule packaged with that version. If you go into the moose directory and do a git log in the newer version I would suspect all MOOSE commits to be the same as the older version plus any new commits in those 3 days. This is not the case. The old submodule will have MOOSE commits on say Jan 4. But then if you update to the new moose submodule in the newer version and the submodule git log shows zero commits on Jan 4. Why would the Jan 4 commit inside the MOOSE submodule be present in the older version of BISON but not the newest? The submodule should have been updated and new commits added, but old commits should not be removed.",

                  "bodyText": "Hi Etienne,\nACGrGrPoly is a class derived from ACGrGrBase, which is in turn derived from ACBulk. Multiplying by the Allen-Cahn mobility L actually is done in ACBulk in the function precomputeQpResidual. ACBulk is a then a derived class of KernelValue. Multiplying by the test function is done in KernelValue.\nTo get started with a grain-growth simulation, I'd suggest using one of the example input files in the MOOSE repository and changing parameters for your problem, rather than trying to create your own input file. The simplest to start with is probably moose/modules/phase_field/examples/grain_growth/grain_growth_2D_random.i. You can change the number of order parameters using the global parameter op_num and change initial conditions to what you prefer. This example uses the Action system to add all the required kernels and materials to obtain the evolution equations.\nAs far as the non-physical behavior you were seeing, I looked quickly at your input file and I think the problem is at least partially coming from the fact that you are specifying v = 'eta0 eta1 eta2' as a GlobalParam. Each ACGrGrPoly kernel needs v specified, and it needs to be a list of all the other order parameters in the system besides the nonlinear variable for that kernel. For example in the ACGrGrPoly kernel for variable = eta0, you would specify v = 'eta1 eta2'. With v specified as a GlobalParam you end up with extra terms in your evolution equations which do not give the correct physics. For these reasons I'd suggest you start with the example from the paragraph above which uses the action system to fill in the correct kernels and parameters specified to each one.",
