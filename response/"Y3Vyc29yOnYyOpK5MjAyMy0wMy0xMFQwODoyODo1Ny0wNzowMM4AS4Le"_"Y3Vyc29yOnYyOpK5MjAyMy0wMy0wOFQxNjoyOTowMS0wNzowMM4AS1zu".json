DED capabilities will be coming online from several members of the development team this year - the points of contact for those efforts would be @dewenyushu and @jiangwen84 if they want to chime in.\nMALAMUTE is currently a licensed INL code, which means you should first contact the INL Technology Deployment office (see https://inl.gov/inl-initiatives/technology-deployment/) in order to obtain a license.",

It takes about a minute to do 1000 timesteps with all timesteps = 1s, i.e. not cutbacks are needed.\nIf I change the defualt timestep to dt = 0.1s, then after a few steps it starts cutting back the timestep to even shorter times, struggles to solve and ultimately reaches the minimum timestep value and fails to complete the solve.\nIf I make dt = 10s, it solves quickly with no cutbacks.  The solution is pretty much the same as for dt = 1s, but coarser as expected.\nI had always thought that if a solve was struggling, making timesteps shorter would help with this.  But here exactly the opposite is happening!\nHas anybody else seen this anomalous behaviour?  Any ideas on what is causing it and how to fix it?\nThanks!",

It looks like I need to go and do some reading to understand what might be causing my problem - and if possible fix it.\nI need to take my understanding of the relevant mathematical processes applied in scaling or normalisation from the equivalent of A-level or simple undergraduate statistics in the UK (high school and college in the US?) to what MOOSE is doing when scaling solves to try and achieve an efficient and accurate solution.  I come from a materials science and engineering background, so not familiar with a lot of the applied math(s) and computer science terminology which is used.\nAre there any books or other resources you can recommend?

What I initially understood is that both of them are couplable_variables, am I right? If that is the case, why are they behaving differently? Please see below the input file that can reproduce my conclusion (replace v by displacements and the results will not be the same)\nAnother issue is w.r.t the jacobian computation when explicitly specifying v=variable (the default nonlinear variable).  As indicated in the documentation, if the v is not specified, the default nonlinear variable will be used for v (i.e. v=variable). Now, if the two lines in the kernel block were uncommented, it will result in an incorrect solution. However, if the ADMatDiffusion is used, it results in the correct solution, indicating the jacobian is not computed properly when explicitly specifying v=variable.\nI can work on a fix for these and submit a PR after confirming it and if you think it is worth fixing it.\nPlease see the expected (correct solution below):\n\n[Mesh]\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n  dim = 1\n  xmin = 0\n  xmax = 1\n  nx = 1000\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [ui]\n  []\n  [ur]\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [uxr_left_1]\n    type = CoupledVarNeumannBC\n    variable = ur\n    boundary = 'left'\n    v = ui\n    coef = 99.627 \n  []\n  [uxr_left_2]\n    type = CoupledVarNeumannBC\n    variable = ur\n    boundary = 'left'\n    v = ur\n    coef = -4.969 \n  []\n\n  [uxi_left_1]\n    type = CoupledVarNeumannBC\n    variable = ui\n    boundary = 'left'\n    v = ui\n    coef = -4.969\n  []\n  [uxi_left_2]\n    type = CoupledVarNeumannBC\n    variable = ui\n    boundary = 'left'\n    v = ur\n    coef = -99.627 \n  []\n  [right_real]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = ur\n    value = 1\n    boundary = right\n  []\n  [right_imaginery]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = ui\n    value = 0\n    boundary = right\n  []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [sigma_rr]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = ur\n    diffusivity = 1\n    # v = ur\n  []\n  [sigma_ii]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = ur\n    diffusivity = -0.1\n    v = ui\n  []\n  [sigma_ri]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = ui\n    diffusivity = 1\n    # v = ui\n  []\n  [sigma_ir]\n    type = MatDiffusion\n    variable = ui\n    diffusivity = 0.1\n    v = ur\n  []\n  [reaction_real]\n    type = Reaction\n    variable = ur\n    rate = -10000\n  []\n  [reaction_imag]\n    type = Reaction\n    variable = ui\n    rate = -10000\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Steady\n  solve_type = LINEAR\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu'\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  exodus = true\n[]",
