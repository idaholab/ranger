          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE Community,\nI am trying to run a simulation using ComputeLinearElasticPhaseFieldFractureStress with a custom degradation function defined as:\nexpression = '((1.0-c)^2)/((1.0-c)^2+a1c(1-0.5*c))'\nwhere a1 is an element-wise property that varies for each element. I provide these values as input to MOOSE, expecting the software to compute the degradation function dynamically based on the elemental data. However, it does not seem to work as intended.\nCould you please guide me on how to properly implement this functionality? Are there any specific settings or methods required to ensure that MOOSE correctly utilizes the element-wise values of a1 in the degradation function?\nI have attached the a1 values and the MOOSE script related to a1 values as well.\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n[UserObjects]\n    [a1_read]\n        type = PropertyReadFile\n        prop_file_name = 'a1_values.csv'\n        nprop = 1\n        read_type = element\n    []\n[]\n\n\n[Functions]\n    [a1_fun]\n        type = PiecewiseConstantFromCSV\n        read_prop_user_object = 'a1_read'\n        read_type = 'element'\n        column_number = '0'\n    []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n    [./a1]\n        type = GenericFunctionMaterial\n        prop_names = a1\n        prop_values = a1_fun\n    [../]    \n\n    [./degradation]\n        type = DerivativeParsedMaterial\n        property_name = degradation\n        coupled_variables = 'c'\n        material_property_names = 'a1'\n        expression = '((1.0-c)^2)/((1.0-c)^2+a1*c*(1-0.5*c))'\n        derivative_order = 2\n    [../]\n[]\n\na1_values.csv",

We do support using the mesh generators to create files, then loading them using a FileMeshComponent. Then kernels and BCs can be added to their mesh.\nAlternatively, the FileMeshPhysicsComponent can be used in combination with a Physics (which is just a bunch of kernels, bcs, materials etc)\n\nI started building up this file (just a line, and a box) and get a segmentation fault for some reason.\n\nAh we should have a clean error for this. I ll push a patch. Thank you for reporting",

This lattice is composed of multiple bubbles/circles that will move around the simulation. The defect/nuclei that are inserted have an ETA = 0, and the original red structure has an ETA = 1. Is there a built-in post processor that can track these circles and return any type of data, such as radius, area or quantity of bubbles? I can not use the built-in Discrete Nucleation post-processors, as some of the nuclei will diffuse or recombine with others. I use the Grand Potential Multi Phase Multi Order Phase Filed Model in MOOSE. I have attached a gif below with these circles and their behavior, and I have also attached my input file. Let me know if my kernels are needed for added context.\n\nmultiphase_omega_template.txt",

The single phase-field variable has a value of -1 and 1 inside two different phases. Interestingly, FeatureFloodCount is only counting phases having a field value of 1. It is not counting the phases having a value of -1 and therefore, not included in the CSV file. Means, FeatureFloodCount is only considering the phase value range from 0 to 1, while 0 to -1 is neglected. Do I need to adjust something in the FeatureFloodCount so that the entire range 1 to -1 is included in the counting process? Do you have advice for me? Thanks.",

Each restart is initialized over the part of the mesh they share with the previous simulation with the previous solution, and with an initial condition for the new part of the domain\ncreate new user objects that create new elements in the mesh.
