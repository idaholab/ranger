          "bodyText": "Dear All,\nI want to use the small strain H1NOSPD with a different weight function. Currently, the weight function is hard coded as weight_nb = _horizon_radius[_qp] / origin_vec_nb.norm();, and it appears in the loop calculating the shape and deformation tensor and in _multi[_qp].\nI changed it to std::pow(_horizon_radius[_qp] / origin_vec_nb.norm(), 2.0); and the Jacobian tests failed. I expected that failure and strain tests would fail as their results are compared against gold files, which have a different weight function. But why would Jacobian tests fail? As I understand, in jacobian tests, the hand-coded Jacobian is compared against a finite difference Jacobian from PETSC. The change in the weight function should not affect Jacobian tests. Am I misunderstanding something here?\nWhat would be the best way to change the weight function?\nBest regards\nAndris",

In this model, dislocations evolve via transport (advection kind of model) within the grain and also there is transfer across the Grain Boundary(GB). Among others, there's a material class inherited from 'CrystalPlasticityStressUpdateBase' that compute the dislocation velocity vector which needs resolved shear stress as input. The flux across the GB depends on the local resolved shear stress via dislocation velocity. This transfer across GB is implemented as an interface kernel. That's where we need those material properties for the element-face and face-neighbor. We can always approximate those values with volumetric value in the current element and the neighbor element of the current element-face as long as those material properties are accessible within the interface kind of kernel.",

You can either output specific components of the tensor with RankTwoAux as the auxkernel, or as a scalar quantity that makes sense for your problem with RankTwoScalarAux.\nHope this helps!",

          "bodyText": "Dear Dr Chris Green,\nI met a problem while working on a reactive transport problem with porous flow module. In my case, there is a fracture through the domain and 2 species plus water flow through. There is constant pressure drop through the domain and constant injection rate, so I use two DirichletBC for pressure, DirichletBC for injection and PorousFlowOutflowBC for the species outlet. However, I observed weird species accumulation at the outlet where the fracture is(as shown in the picture).\nIn the simulation I use lower dimensional fracture capability. I wonder if PorousFlowOutflowBC doesn't work for lower dimensional fracture. Could you give me some suggestions on the boundary condition choices? I've attached my input file. Please let me know if you need more information.\nThanks so much for your help!\nBest,\nMengnan\ninput file:\nporous_flow_fractured_example.i.zip\n\n@cpgr",
