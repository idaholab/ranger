There are no nvidia libraries available on the compute nodes, since there need be no graphics there. However, the nvidia libraries are available on the login nodes. Also, the architecture of our login nodes and compute nodes are different, hence MOOSE must be built on the compute nodes.\nNow, here is the situation:\n\n\nit is possible to build MOOSE on the login nodes (having nvidia libs) and run them on the broadwell nodes; but such binaries run suboptimally on Skylake nodes. Hence, it seems that the nvidia libraries are not used at runtime, and it is possible to ignore them\n\n\nit is not possible to compile MOOSE on the compute nodes, due to the error below:\n\n\n  CXX      apps/version.o\n  CXX      utilities/src/metaphysicl_version.lo\n  CXXLD    libmetaphysicl.la\n/dirApps/binutils/2.28-GCCcore-6.4.0/bin/ld.gold: error: cannot f\nind -lnvidia-ml\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[4]: *** [libmetaphysicl.la] Error 1\nmake[4]: Leaving directory `/myData/work/MOOSE/moo\nse/libmesh/build/contrib/metaphysicl/src'\nmake[3]: *** [all] Error 2\nmake[3]: Leaving directory `/myData/work/MOOSE/moo\nse/libmesh/build/contrib/metaphysicl/src'\nmake[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/myData/work/MOOSE/moo\nse/libmesh/build/contrib/metaphysicl'\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/myData/work/MOOSE/moo\nse/libmesh/build/contrib'\nmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nNow my questions:\n\nHow can I get around the nvidia dependency?\nHow do I (re)set the LDFLAGS and LIBS env. vars. when executing the update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh script?\nI also would like to add -march=native flag too, if not already introduced by you\nDo you need more inputs from my side?\n\nI have attached the full logs and the bash script which I use building MOOSE.\nI thank you in advance for your support.\nRegards\nEhsan\nmoose.log.tar.gz",

You may be seeing a check for OpenCL that MetaPhysicL performs....in which case (if you don't need openCL support), I would try adding --disable-opencl to the update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh script when libMesh is configured (look at lines 151 - 162 in the current version of the script)\n\n\nLDFLAGS and LIBS should be able to be set directly on the command line. (export LDFLAGS=[flags] and export LIBS=[flags]). LibMesh configure should pick them up. @roystgnr can comment more on this if I am wrong.\n\n\nAdding --enable-march to the configure lines in the libmesh script (as mentioned above) allows libmesh to determine the correct -march flag for the system, if I'm interpreting libmesh configure correctly. Try this first. If this doesn't work, you should be able to add -march=native to CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS for your system.\n\n\nHopefully this helps!",

I don't see --disable-opencl in this list, but it is a MetaPhysicL configure option, so perhaps it's being passed through by the libmesh configure script (not sure). I found that option by searching in the MetaPhysicL repository, located at (https://github.com/roystgnr/MetaPhysicL).

MetaPhysicL allows an optional build with VexCL, and tests for OpenCL to see if this is possible.  libMesh doesn't have anything to do (directly) with either, but does pass any configure arguments along to its subpackages.\nTrying to configure on a different system than you build on is pretty much never going to be supported, I'm afraid - we'd have to turn off all our autodetection to make that safe.  And that \"-lnvidia-ml\" must getting inserted by a library on an Nvidia-possessing system here; ax_check_cl.m4 only tries out -lOpenCL, -lCL, and -lclparser, not any library with a vendor-specific name.",

Dividing the area fraction postprocessor value by the other in a ParsedFunction was all that was required. Guess I should have been more clear on what I was after. Though to @dschwen 's credit, using the GenericFunctionMaterial would have worked too. Both require an extra step.\nWhat would also be neat is a ParsedPostprocessor where I can just divide the two postprocessors directly instead of making the intermediate function. Then you might be able to get rid of Difference, LinearCombination, and Scale postprocessors, and maybe a few others.",
