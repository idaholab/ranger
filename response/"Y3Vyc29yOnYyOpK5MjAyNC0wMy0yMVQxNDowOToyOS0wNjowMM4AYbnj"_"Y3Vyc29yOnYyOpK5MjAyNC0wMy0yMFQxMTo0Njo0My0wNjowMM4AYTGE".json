Is there any reason this would be impractical?\nThanks for your time,\nGabriele",

I believe it to be related to the MPI flavor (MPICH vs OpenMPI vs MVAPICH, etc).\nThe reason I ignore it, is because MOOSE (and MOOSE based applications) use PETSc extensively so, and we supply our own testing system (TestHarness), via run_tests to test the stack. Through these many thousands of tests we believe we satisfy a \"working PETSc\" installation when they all pass.\nAs for targeting a specific feature/contrib of PETSc though, I am not an expert on. For example, I don't know which tests to ask you to run that make extensive use of SLEPc. But I think I know of a rudimentary way:\nWhen I grep for \"slepc_version\" in the test folder (moose/test), I see several tests that require SLEPc:\ncd moose/test\ngit grep \"slepc_version\"\nLooks like a bunch of \"eigensolver\"-like tests all require SLEPc. Lets run those tests specifically:\ncd moose/test\nmake -j 6\n./run_tests --re=eigensolvers\nDo these all pass? If so, honestly, I would assume SLEPc (and PETSc) is sufficiently being tested.",
