          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI have a problem which I have encountered in the past that is coming up again. I use gmsh for meshing.\nWhen I create a 2D mesh, and define 1D physical groups (lines), MOOSE is able to recognize those lines as boundaries and do things like apply Neumann conditions, use VectorPostProcessors like SideValueSampler, etc.\nHowever, when I create a 3D mesh and define 1D physical groups, I get the error:\n(VectorPostprocessors/upper_right_z_disp/boundary):\n    the following side sets (ids) do not exist on the mesh: sample_location (19)\n\n    MOOSE distinguishes between \"node sets\" and \"side sets\" depending on whether\n    you are using \"Nodal\" or \"Integrated\" BCs respectively. Node sets corresponding\n    to your side sets are constructed for you by default.\n\n    Try setting \"Mesh/construct_side_list_from_node_list=true\" if you see this error.\n    Note: If you are running with adaptivity you should prefer using side sets.\n\nThis only shows up for 1D physical groups. 2D physical groups/boundaries work fine. Also, \"construct_side_list_from_node_list=true\" does not change anything.\nBased off of this behavior, If I understand correctly, the way it works is that \"sides\" can only be 1 dimension less than the dimension of the mesh. But then what do I do if I want to apply a line load on a 3D mesh? Or in my case (reason for making this post), sample a value along a curved line? LineValueSampler can't work for me there because that can only define straight lines.\nInterestingly enough, a 0D physical group had no issues applying a Dirichlet BC.\nI saw this answer #24174 from @jwpeterson , where it was suggested to add \"lower_dimensional_block\" to my mesh file, so I went ahead and did:\n$MeshFormat\n4.1 0 8\n$EndMeshFormat\n$PhysicalNames\n2\n0 18 \"loading_point\"\n1 19 \"sample_location\" lower_dimensional_block\n$EndPhysicalNames\n$Entities\n7 12 8 1\n1 0 0 0 0 \n2 0 0.002 0 0 \n3 0 -0.002 0 0 \n4 0 0 0.002 1 18 \n5 0 0 -0.002 0 \n6 0.002 0 0 0 \n7 -0.002 0 0 0 \n1 -6.389406329081476e-05 -6.389406329081475e-05 -6.389406329081475e-05 6.389406329081476e-05 0.002063894063290815 0.002063894063290815 0 2 4 -2 \n2 -2.334153974494834e-05 -2.334153974494803e-05 -0.002023341539744949 2.334153974494834e-05 0.002023341539744949 2.334153974494846e-05 0 2 2 -5 \n\n\nbut nothing changed. How can I fix this so I can sample points along a curved line in 3D? I attached here my gmsh file, a simple sphere, and I want to sample the value of the displacement along a curved line on the surface from the top to the right side.\n// Gmsh project created on Wed Oct 16 19:47:43 2024\nSetFactory(\"OpenCASCADE\");\n//+\nPoint(1) = {0, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(2) = {0, 0.002, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(3) = {0, -0.002, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(4) = {0, 0, 0.002, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(5) = {0, 0, -0.002, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(6) = {0.002, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(7) = {-0.002, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nCircle(1) = {4, 1, 2};\n//+\nCircle(2) = {2, 1, 5};\n//+\nCircle(3) = {6, 1, 2};\n//+\nCircle(4) = {2, 1, 7};\n//+\nCircle(5) = {4, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(6) = {5, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(7) = {6, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(8) = {7, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(9) = {4, 1, 7};\n//+\nCircle(10) = {4, 1, 6};\n//+\nCircle(11) = {6, 1, 5};\n//+\nCircle(12) = {5, 1, 7};\n//+\nCurve Loop(2) = {1, -3, -10};\n//+\nSurface(1) = {2};\n//+\nCurve Loop(4) = {9, -4, -1};\n//+\nSurface(2) = {4};\n//+\nCurve Loop(6) = {2, -11, 3};\n//+\nSurface(3) = {6};\n//+\nCurve Loop(8) = {2, 12, -4};\n//+\nSurface(4) = {8};\n//+\nCurve Loop(10) = {5, -7, -10};\n//+\nSurface(5) = {10};\n//+\nCurve Loop(12) = {7, -6, -11};\n//+\nSurface(6) = {12};\n//+\nCurve Loop(14) = {6, -8, -12};\n//+\nSurface(7) = {14};\n//+\nCurve Loop(16) = {5, -8, -9};\n//+\nSurface(8) = {16};\n//+\nSurface Loop(1) = {7, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 8};\n//+\nVolume(1) = {1};\n//+\nSurface Loop(2) = {5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8};\n//+\nPhysical Point(\"loading_point\", 18) = {4};\n//+\nPhysical Curve(\"sample_location\", 19) = {10};",

To do so, i coupled our in-house moose-based code (correspounding for THM) with a code (correspounding for dynaimc rupture and seismicity).\nthe coupling parameter is stress tensor between the codes.\nafter the seismicty, the focal mechanism appears in the reactivated area. theoritically, it should be clear at the correspounding horizon, but as you can see in the figure below the the focal mechanism is not clear (symetric) as well as the stress change is not smooth enough.\n\nFigure above shows the stress change as elemental variable, so i changed it o nodal variable (figure below) but still  the smoothness of the stress is not good enough and the focal mechanism is not clear.\n\nBTW, the element size around around the focal mechanism is 1 m.\nhow can i resolve these issues?\nThanks in advance,\nRahim",

Converting to a discussion.\nIt looks as though the company, or organization you are with, blocks your access to https://github.com (and probably all outbound sites via the terminal), by means of first requiring you to use their ROOT Certificates. Just like us, here at INL. This is basically so they can watch what you're doing (which is called an MITM attack, if it were an actual threat actor). Stating this, just in case you are actually falling victim to an MITM... Please look into this, if you are in fact using a personal machine.\nI see this error when one does not have their certificates properly set up.\nUnfortunately, there is nothing anyone here can do to help you other than your own organization's network team. They should be providing you with the certificates, and how to enable them within your terminal. If you know what you are doing you should be able to extrapolate what your favorite web browser is doing when navigating to https://github.com, and extract that certificate to somewhere on your drive, and export a few influential environment variables to let git know where they are. My exact setup to show you what those environment variables are:\n\u276f env | grep -i root\nREQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nSSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nCURL_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nYour network team should be providing you with the *.crt file. Anyways... One work-around that might work, and should not be considered a \"fix\" or used for extended amounts of time, is to bypass SSL verification temporarily:\nGIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose\nThis effectually turns off SSL protections. The errors you are seeing are actually \"good\" errors. The program is trying to alert to you something is wrong with your secure connection. That there isn't one!\nThe other thing you can do is to not use HTTPs protocol, and instead create an SSH public/private key pair, and clone MOOSE that way: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent\nUsing SSH is the preferred way to clone MOOSE anyway, if you plan on making changes and commiting them back MOOSE.",

This example that I made for now is for a 2D case; I will modify it for 3D.\nI am working with a 2D mesh and I need to apply initial stress fields (\u03c3_xx, \u03c3_yy, \u03c3_xy) on the right boundary. These stress fields are expressed as functions of the length of the mesh (i.e., vary along the boundary).\nI've been unable to find an example that demonstrates how to specify these stress fields correctly. The closest example I found was in issue #26104 , but I still couldn't figure out how to properly define and apply the stress expressions on the boundary.\nTo give an idea, this is my mesh.\n\nOne method I tried to think was to get reaction forces from these stresses and then apply these forces as the function of length over mesh in the boundary condition.

When using PBCs, the deformation on one boundary is matched by an equal and opposite deformation on the opposing boundary, leading to zero average stress, which is problematic in this case, where we are aiming for a non-zero stress state, especially in the loading direction.\nIs there a way where we just apply the displacement in Z so that I can have periodicity around disp_z for Z face too?\nCan anyone help me with that?",
