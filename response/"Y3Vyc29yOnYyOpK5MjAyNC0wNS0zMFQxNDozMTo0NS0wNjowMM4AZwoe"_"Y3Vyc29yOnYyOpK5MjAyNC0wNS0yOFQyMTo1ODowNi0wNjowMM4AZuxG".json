          "bodyText": "Hi,\nIs there a possibility in Moose to create polycrystaline structures in the form of tessallations and use that for crystal plasticity simulations? These tessallations would obviously need meshed in a suitable format that Moose understands. I have managed to create the polycrystalline meshes through neper and used that in Moose, but felt would be more convenient if all of them can be done within Moose. Can some one point me to the right set of examples?\nKind regards,\nArun",

Naturally, the Euler angle information (indicating the orientation of the grains) needs to be preserved. And I have some questions needed to address.\n1. How can MOOSE stop the GBEvolution at a desired time, and then conduct a pure mechanical stress analysis?\n2. How can we utilize BndsCalcIC to define grain boundary blocks and assign special material parameters to the interfacial region in the mechanical stress analysis?\n3. If there are any alternative solutions, please do let me know.\nI have tried some attempts, but don't find proper method to stop the grain boundary growth. I need the euler angle information of the grains in the mechanical analysis. Thank you!\nBest wishes!\nYaode Yin",

You could:\nChange the equations after the desired time by\n\nadding a time derivative with a very very high coefficient that prevents any change in the solution\nuse the control system to turn off kernels for the variables of interest. Just keep the time derivative kernel that's it\n\nCreate a checkpoint and restart with a different set of equations.\nThis is the best option if the variables are different in the second part of the solve. You do not want to have nonlinear variables that you just want to freeze.\nSimilarly you can create a multiapp that does the second solve.\nThe first solve runs to completion, then executed the multiapp on FINAL to perform the second part.\nYou can transfer fields from the first solve to the second one\nGuillaume",

In the parent system, the elastic tensor is computed by ComputePolycrystalElasticityTensor, which functions with the grain tracker . But in the subsystem, I stop the grain growth, and want to make a pure mechanical analysis. I think I cannot use ComputePolycrystalElasticityTensor in the subsystem. What 's the substitute?  And how can I ensure that each grains retains the same elastic tensor as those in the parent system?\nBy the way, I also want to distinguish the grain interiors and boundaries in the subsystem.  I realize BndsCalc may be helpful. Can I directly copy the bnds  variables from the parent system into the subsystem via MultiAppCopyTransfer for distinguishing grain boundaries?",

          "bodyText": "Check these boxes if you have followed the posting rules.\n\n Q&A Navier Stokes is the most appropriate category for my question\n I have consulted the posting Guidelines on the Discussions front page\n I have searched the Discussions forum and my question has not been asked before\n I have searched the MOOSE website and the documentation does not answer my question\n I have formatted my post following the posting guidelines (avoid screenshots if possible, triple back quotes before/after pasted text, etc)\n\nQuestion\nYou can see some previous discussion in #27159\nI am trying to couple a multiphase navier stokes simulation subApp to a PorousFlow Main app.\nThe NS app is modeling magma flow in a narrow channel it is largely based on the Gallium solidification example but it has a non-linear melt fraction temperature relationship. It is the smaller domain and makes up the left boundary of the porous flow app. It is intended to model a magmatic dike.\nThe PorousFlow app uses the simple fluid and solves for heat conduction and advection on a large domain on one side of the dike. I added a loglinear permeability temperature relationship.\nThey are coupled in a multiapp with sub cycling and picard iteration so that the NS app can have smaller timesteps. It's a simple grid of two rectangles each with different resolutions which touch on the right and interface boundaries. The meshes are created seperately in each input file and uses the positions flag in the MultiApp set up. Right now it converges and yields a result but I don't think it physically looks right.\nCurrently, here's how the coupling is set up:\n\nthe heat flow from the porous flow app is calculated on 'timestep_begin' using a VariableGradientComponent and transfered to the sub app MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestNodeTransfer where $k*\\delta T *dt$ is calculated and set to the FVFunctorNeumannBC\n\nthe temperature of the NS app is transfered to an auxvariable in the porousflow app using MultiAppGeneralFieldShapeEvaluationTransfer and set to the interface boundary using MatchedValueBC\n\n\nReading in some discussion and my own intuition says that this isn't the best way to do it. @GiudGiud adviced against it in #26189. I know that the heat flow across the BC is not conserved in the current model.\nMy goal is to figure out a transfer that allows spatial variability of heat transfer (mainly in the Y direction) along the length of the dike. We would expect based on our understanding of multiphase flow in the dike and hydrothermal circulation around the dike for there to be \"hotspots\" and \"cold spots\" which will lead to non-homogenous flow.\nFor this reason I didn't use SideLayeredAverage or various similar ones but I think I could use LineValueSampler.\nSome points I was confused about:\n\n\nwhat are the correct dimensions for FVFunctorNeumannBC?\nin 2d-rc-transient.i test I noticed the value for the functor is u_inlet * rho * cp * T_inlet which has dimensions of $L*\\frac{M}{L^3}\\frac{L^2M}{T^2*\\theta}*\\theta = \\frac{M^2}{L^2}$\nBecause of this I set the value to $k\\nabla T * dt$ which a rough approximation of the integral over t. Both k and gradTx come from the parent app. For testing k is constant and isotropic and since we are dealing with a simple grid I just transfer one component from gradT (gradTx >> gradTy). Either way, the way I set it up is definitely suspect.\n\n\nFVFunctorNeumannBC should have + values for heat flux IN and - values for heat flux out correct? It should be similar to the FE NeumannBC where $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} = \\nabla u \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\text{value}$\n\n\nProbably related to (1) but I tried setting up a postprocessor to conserve heat flux between apps but I couldn't get it to run at all.\n\n\nI did write a custom aux kernal that calculates the heat flow in the porousflow app which I could use to transfer but considering that I added the permeability temperature relationship, permability goes very low around the dike (10e-20) so it is mostly heat conduction anyway. I can add this in in the future or now if it would help but the units and conservation thing were a concern.\nYou can find it here\n\n\nThis is mostly a demo for the thesis which is due next week (it's last minute :( but I'm so close to getting it correct ) so it's okay if it's not perfect I'd really just like to include it for a cool example.\nHere's the repo:

Do I need to renormalize on both sides or use heatflux on both sides?\nTo simplify everything I am going to assume that at the boundary around the dike heat flow is purely diffusive (this is reasonable because the dike melts and quenches the host rock around it into glass) so I can use SideDiffusiveFluxIntegral.\nThe original inspiration for transfering temperature on one side and heat flux on the other side are from this example",

Then GiudGiud recommended some preconditioning options what I am using now. Then it becomes faster then previous. In my previous simulation I used 64 cores only for 50k elements without proper calculations. Now I use the number of processors/cores by calculating as follows: no_elements*4 dfs/20,000. Earlier I got only 175 time_steps solve in 12 hrs and 64 cores but now I am getting more than 175 time steps  solves with only 6 cores/processors.",
