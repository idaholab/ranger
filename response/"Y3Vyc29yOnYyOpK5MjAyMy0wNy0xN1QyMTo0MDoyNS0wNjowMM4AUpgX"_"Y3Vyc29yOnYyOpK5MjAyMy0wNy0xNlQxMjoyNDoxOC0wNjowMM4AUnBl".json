If you use AD then you do not need to hand-code a Jacobian.\n\n\nwhat is off-diagonal Jacobian and when do we need to calculate it? Based on the link above, there is no off-diagonal Jacobian. Is there any introduction about what these variables (such as jvar, jac) mean?\n\n\nWith AD no Jacobian routines are necessary. I would recommend starting with AD and then once you are modeling your physics successfully you can worry about optimizing code speed and hand-coding your Jacobians.\n\n\nhow do we decide which kind of other base objects to heritage? Because in the tutorial, it shows \" ADDiffusion : public ADKernelGrad\" and I can only find these examples.\n\n\nIf the weak form of your term only involves the test function and not its gradient, then you can use ADKernelValue. If you only use the test function gradient and not its value, then you use ADKernelGrad.  If it uses both gradient and value, then you use ADKernel.",
