For instance, if I know, maybe based on a postprocessor value, that I'm in a period that is nearly steady state, can I bump up my timestep? I know the timestep will increase eventually, but I may want to increase it by several orders of magnitude but that can take a while even with a modest growth factor.",

An alternative is to refactor the TimeStepper system as TimeStepModifiers, similar to MeshModifiers in that they can be represented as a directed acyclic graph, where we can do the usual dependency resolution business.\nA lot of things could benefit from DAGs, the MeshModifier and Executor are good examples... I hope someday we can compose the entire MOOSE simulation as a big DAG....",

I generally just skip that step.\nIt has been a few months since I have gone through this, but I do remember needing to also manually install the gcc toolchain for WSL. You may also want to do the following:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThat should get you gcc, g++, make, etc. If you are missing any tools, you should be able to just manually install anything using sudo apt-get install [tool] from this point on.",

Specifically, I\u2019m following the powerlawcreepstressupdate, so I\u2019m inheriting from the radialreturncreepstressupdate.\n\nAlthough my model compiled and ran successfully, I\u2019m not getting the exact results. I think it has to do with the way I implemented the parameter, $\u03f5_k$. This parameter should be the accumulated scalar creep $\u03f5_k$ obtained from the scalar creep rate $\\dot{\u03f5_k}$ computed from the previous and current steps. Instead of the accumulated values, I\u2019m getting values corresponding to only one step for each $\u03f5_k$. Could someone please help?

In my current simulation, I am unable to use the same function on the top surface of my indenter model. It results in no contact between them.\n\nI can get contact by moving the bottom surface of the indenter, however, this makes my output of force erroneous.

I am having issues with it not converging with sharp interfaces. To simplify the problem, I have a created a minimum worked example for the advection of a circle in 2D using a single fluid with a constant user specified velocity. To test if the issue is a having a sharp step, I am using a smoothed step function, the idea being the smoothness parameter can be dropped to get closer to an ideal step function. The input file is below. The best results I can get are using crank-nicolson with a Van Leer flux limiter and the default petsc options (although ILU performs almost identically) but there is still quite a lot of excessive diffusion, as in the images below. Pushing the smoothing parameter below 0.0005 (so driving it closer to a step) stops it converging. I can't see anything I am obviously doing wrong, but I suspect I am missing something. My only other thoughts are around trying to implement a more complex flux limiter scheme such as CICSAM.

This will make the problem faster to run and wont affect results at this point. You may just comment out the kernel and turn the T variable into an auxiliary variable.\nThis is similar to several text book / code studies of the diffusivity / quality of discretization schemes that you may have already found out there\nhttps://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithm/adv-schemes.html\nhttps://folk.ntnu.no/leifh/teaching/tkt4140/._main074.html\nIt'd be nice to look at the FOAM equivalent if it s out there\nVanLeer makes sense as a good candidate\nDo you have the (non)convergence history for a non-converging case?\nCan you print each variable's residuals in [Debug]?\nIs it the linear or non linear iterative convergence that is not reached?\nGuillaume",

it does look like phi is the one struggling to converge. Thanks for the links, I will take a look at them. I know that FOAM, specifically interFOAM, has some nice examples of this, it is on my to do list to try to back out of the code what they implement as I have not yet found a good summary of it.",

I don't have a particular need to resolve both simultaneously, I am happy to do a split solve and use multi-apps to do it. My issue with that is that the standard FVAdvection kernel only supports average, upwind and skewness-corrected so I can't see an obvious way to implement something like VanLeer or other flux limiters, am I missing something? The input file above is effectively me trying to advect only the scalar field, hence setting a constant velocity, but using the INSFVScalarFieldAdvection kernel to move the scalar as that can use VanLeer and other flux limiters. All the other kernels are added to get the minimum required to get the Navier Stokes kernels to run. I suspect that even cutting out the resolution of the velocity field will still result in the same issues but I am not certain, I will try to build up and example without any Navier Stokes.",
