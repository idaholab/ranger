I'm using a PostProcessor that simply checks if the transient has run for 60+ seconds to determine that it has \"converged\":\n[stoch_tools_converged]\n    type = PostprocessorComparison\n    comparison_type = greater_than_equals\n    value_a = time\n    value_b = 60\n[]\n\nIf I change bool to value, I correctly get an error stating that the reporter has been requested of type std::vector<bool> but declared of type std::vector<double>. This indicates to me that my usage is fundamentally wrong. Based off the wording, I would think converged_reporter requires a bool, but I can't find any tests demonstrating usage of these keywords to guide me. Any help would be appreciated.\nAlso, as a side note, if  StochasticTools can print multiapp_converged in output .csv files, why can't skip_unconverged_samples simply be set to true without need for additional manipulation?",

Could you post your inputs to see exactly what you are trying to do?\nTo summarize how skip_unconverged_samples works. First, SamplerReporterTransfer automatically creates a reporter value of type std::vector<bool> which contains a value for each sample, true if the solve was able to converge and false if it doesn't. Whether the solve converged or not directly determined from the sub-app's nonlinear system, there is no need for a separate postprocessor or reporter to determine this. Second, these values are transferred to a StochasticReporter so the resulting name is <stochastic_reporter_name>/<transfer_name>:converged. Finally, the trainer has the option to skip samples where the solve did not converge by setting skip_unconverged_samples = true and converged_reporter = <stochastic_reporter_name>/<transfer_name>:converged.",

Issues there are: 1. what is the solution scheme to compute level set and physics model? Concurrently coupling or staggered coupling? 2. XFEM will cut the mesh, and you need some constraints to heal the mesh to run level set evolution equation.\nSecond, the set of equations does not seem to be complete. I think we still need a Dirichlet like BC to enforce the temperature jump. So far, you only have the flux BCs on the interface. For both interfacial conditions, you can use ElemElemConstraint to implement your weak forms.\nLastly, we have been developing a mesh-based moving interface capability. We use a mesh to represent the interface and we calculate the interface velocity on the cutting mesh to move the mesh. With that, you do not need to couple level set module. See #17813",

This should be allowed, I don't believe SAM enforces any Executioner parameters. I'm not sure if anyone has previously worked with SAM on a FullSolveMultiApp problem, but it should be possible.\nI just checked with one of our regression test TransientMultiApp problems and was able to run it as a FullSolveMultiApp by setting auto_advance = true in the Transient executioner block of the main app. It seems like it yielded the expected behavior, namely the sub app executing a full simulation for each tilmestep of the main app.",

However, when I view the output with paraview, it's still giving me a value of flow_pot = 0 everywhere. I still used the 'ADMaterialProperty' btw, because the problem I eventually want to do isn't just a generic constant.\nHere's the updated Material source file:\nhttps://pastebin.com/stmsL7fK\nSo I set the _permeability at the quadrature points to always equal the constant value retrieved from the user (with _the_permeability).

If it's a constant, you could use a GenericConstantMaterial. You could also have a look at that file to see how the prop_values are retrieved from the input file and placed in the properties at the quadrature points'\n\nI wonder if we can pre-define material properties such as permeability/porosity in the mesh file (.inp) and MOOSE will recognise it?\nI want to specify a different value of the property at each element (base on element number/ID), is this possible with MOOSE?\nThank you.\nKind regards,\nTraiwit",

          "bodyText": "Hi, I have a mesh created with gmsh with a pretty simple geometry, but I'm having trouble using it with Neumann BCs.\nhttps://easyupload.io/6p4kka\nThe above is the raw/unedited .inp export from gmsh- when I used this I got the error:\n\"Expected boundary element of dimension 2 but got 1\"\nSo I manually deleted all the line and surface elements, and left only the volume element. I applied Dirichlet conditions on one of the \"physical groups\" I created, which is a surface of one side, and it ran fine.\nThe problem I'm facing now is applying Neumann condition to the same surface- I get:\n*** ERROR ***\n    the following side set ids do not exist on the mesh: 3\n\n    MOOSE distinguishes between \"node sets\" and \"side sets\" depending on whether\n    you are using \"Nodal\" or \"Integrated\" BCs respectively. Node sets corresponding\n    to your side sets are constructed for you by default.\n\n    Try setting \"Mesh/construct_side_list_from_node_list=true\" if you see this error.\n    Note: If you are running with adaptivity you should prefer using side sets.\n\nSo I added that argument to the Mesh block, and nothing changed. I also thought it could be the element sets created by gmsh, and since I deleted all the surface elements, I should delete the surface elsets too (and leave only the nodesets). Doing that gave me the error:\n*** ERROR ***\nInvalid dimension dim = 4\n\nI also tried remaking the mesh and instead of defining the surface as the boundary, I'd define the lines that make up the surface as the boundary (in the attached file, these are named \"left_tract\" and \"right_tract\"). I did that and tried in MOOSE but just got a segmentation fault with no backtrace.",
