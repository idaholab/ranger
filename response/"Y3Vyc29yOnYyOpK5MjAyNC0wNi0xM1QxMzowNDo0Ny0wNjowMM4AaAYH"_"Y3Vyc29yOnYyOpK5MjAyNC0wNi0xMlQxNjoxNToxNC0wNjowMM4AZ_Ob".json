          "bodyText": "Hi All,\nI am trying to carry out a simulation of a thin film with an applied epitaxy in the form of an eigenstrain.  In the simulation the thin film sits on top of a substrate which imposes a uniform mismatch strain throughout the film (so long as the film is sufficiently thin).  The domain (both film and substrate) is periodic in the x and y direction.  Applying GlobalStrain to both the film and substrate with just the epitaxy (in the form of an eigenstrain) acting on the film yields some unexpected results, but block restricting and applying GlobalStrain to only the film with the epitaxy applied gives the expected result.  I wanted to attempt to separate out GlobalStrain utilizing block restriction as shown in the input file below, but I get the error:\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the Problem 'MOOSE Problem' of type FEProblem.\n\nMaterial property 'global_strain_film', requested by 'Ferroelectric_SM_strain' is not defined on block 0\nMaterial property 'global_strain_sub', requested by 'Substrate_SM_strain' is not defined on block 1\n\nAs I need the whole domain to be periodic, I believe I need a GlobalStrain on both blocks.  According to the documentation here GlobalStrain, it seems as though I should be able to separate GlobalStrain Objects utilizing block restriction, or is this actually not possible?\nUltimately there will be another eigenstrain contributing to the thin film which will be coupled to the evolution of polarization throughout the volume of the film.  But for now, I am just trying to see if I can establish the mechanical properties of the film and substrate.\nThanks for you time.\n[Mesh]\n  [gen]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 3\n    nx = 10\n    ny = 10\n    nz = 20\n    xmin = -10.0\n    xmax = 10.0\n    ymin = -10.0\n    ymax = 10.0\n    zmin = -10.0\n    zmax = 10.0\n    elem_type = HEX8\n  []\n  [./cnode]\n    input = gen\n    type = ExtraNodesetGenerator\n    coord = '-10.0 -10.0 -10.0'\n    new_boundary = 100\n  [../]\n\n  [subdomains]\n    type = SubdomainBoundingBoxGenerator\n    input = cnode\n    bottom_left = '-10.0 -10.0 -10.0'\n    block_id = 1\n    top_right = '10.0 10.0 0.0'\n    location = INSIDE\n  []\n  [film_interface]\n    type = SideSetsBetweenSubdomainsGenerator\n    input = subdomains\n    primary_block = 0\n    paired_block = 1\n    new_boundary = 52\n  []\n[]\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  displacements = 'u_x u_y u_z'\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [./global_strain_film]\n    order = SIXTH\n    family = SCALAR\n    block = '0'\n  [../]\n\n  [./global_strain_substrate]\n    order = SIXTH\n    family = SCALAR\n    block = '1'\n  [../]\n\n  [./u_x]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    block = '0 1'\n  [../]\n  [./u_y]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    block = '1 0'\n  [../]\n  [./u_z]\n    order = FIRST\n    family = LAGRANGE\n    block = '1 0'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n\n[Materials]\n\n  [./eigen_strain]\n    type = ComputeEigenstrain\n    #    eigen_base = 'x y z yz xz xy'\n    eigen_base = '0.005 0.005 0.003725 0 0 0'\n    eigenstrain_name = epitaxy\n    block = '1 0'\n  [../]\n\n  [./elasticity_tensor_1]\n    type = ComputeElasticityTensor\n    fill_method = symmetric9\n    C_ijkl = '179.073 66.71 66.71 179.073 66.71 179.073 82.6446 82.6446 82.6446'\n  [../]\n\n  [./stress_1]\n    type = ComputeLinearElasticStress\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Physics]\n  [SolidMechanics]\n    [QuasiStatic]\n      [./Ferroelectric_SM]\n        strain = SMALL\n        add_variables = true\n        incremental = false\n        global_strain = global_strain_film\n        eigenstrain_names = 'epitaxy'\n        generate_output = 'strain_xx strain_xy strain_xz strain_yy strain_yz strain_zz vonmises_stress'\n\t       block = '0'\n      [../]\n\n      [./Substrate_SM]\n        strain = SMALL\n        add_variables = true\n        global_strain = global_strain_substrate\n  #      eigenstrain_names = 'epitaxy'\n        incremental = false\n        generate_output = 'strain_xx strain_xy strain_xz strain_yy strain_yz strain_zz vonmises_stress'\n        block = '1'\n      [../]\n    []\n\n    [./GlobalStrain]\n      [./global_strain_film]\n        scalar_global_strain = global_strain_film\n        displacements = 'u_x u_y u_z'\n        auxiliary_displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n        global_displacements = 'ug_x ug_y ug_z'\n        block = '0'\n      [../]\n      [./global_strain_sub]\n        scalar_global_strain = global_strain_substrate\n        displacements = 'u_x u_y u_z'\n        auxiliary_displacements = 'disps_x disps_y disps_z'\n        global_displacements = 'ugs_x ugs_y ugs_z'\n        block = '1'\n      [../]\n    [../]\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [./Periodic]\n    [./xy]\n      auto_direction = 'x y'\n      variable = 'u_x u_y u_z'\n    [../]\n  [../]\n  [./centerfix_x]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = 100\n    variable = u_x\n    value = 0\n  [../]\n  [./centerfix_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = 100\n    variable = u_y\n    value = 0\n  [../]\n  [./centerfix_z]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = 100\n    variable = u_z\n    value = 0\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Preconditioning]\n  [./smp]\n    type = SMP\n    full = true\n    petsc_options = '-snes_ksp_ew'\n    petsc_options_iname = '-ksp_gmres_restart -snes_atol -snes_rtol -ksp_rtol -pc_type'\n    petsc_options_value = '    160             1e-8        1e-6      1e-5        bjacobi'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = 'PJFNK'\n  scheme = 'implicit-euler'\n  dtmin = 1e-13\n  dtmax = 2.0\n  end_time = 10\n  l_max_its = 200\n  automatic_scaling = true\n  [./TimeStepper]\n    type = IterationAdaptiveDT\n    optimal_iterations = 8\n    growth_factor = 1.1\n    cutback_factor = 0.8\n    linear_iteration_ratio = 1000\n    dt = 0.5\n  [../]\n  verbose = true\n  nl_max_its = 16\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  print_linear_residuals = false\n  perf_graph = false\n  [./out]\n    type = Exodus\n    file_base = out_GS_Test\n    interval = 2\n  [../]\n[]",

Phys. Lett. 78, 3878\u20133880 (2001)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1063/1.1377855\nWe get many requests (approx 1-2/month) to be able to solve this problem and I think its time we finally pin this down.\nWe are slowly refactoring things to make them use more MOOSE systems but we still can't find what is going on. As soon as we throw in a second eigenstrain (proportional to the square of the phase field variable), we find that it dominates the calculation whereas instead we expect that at the end of the solve, the global strain of the film block should be very much equal to the eigenstrain \"epitaxy\" that we apply above.\nAs such, the epitaxial condition (eigenstrain) coupling to the phase field problem is only a weak influence.",

Then I utilized the object within Compute Elasticity Tensor CP.\nThe csv file has six columns: three for voronoi tessellation positions (use_random_voronoi = false) and three for Euler angles.\nThe issue is that the tessellation positions are set as Euler angles.\nAm I doing something wrong?\nI saw issue #16716 and was wondering if it was feasible to complete this type of operation using simply PropertyReadFile.\n[UserObjects]\n  [red_prop]\n    type = PropertyReadFile #Running says to use PropertyReadFile instead of elementPropertyReadFile\n    prop_file_name = 'threecry.csv'\n    use_random_voronoi = false\n    read_type = 'voronoi'\n    nvoronoi = 3\n    nprop = 6\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [elasticity_tensor]\n    type = ComputeElasticityTensorCP\n    C_ijkl = '1.684e5 1.214e5 1.214e5 1.684e5 1.214e5 1.684e5 0.754e5 0.754e5 0.754e5'\n    fill_method = symmetric9\n    read_prop_user_object = red_prop\n  []\n\nThanks,\nPaolo Antonioni",

          "bodyText": "Hi All,\nI am having trouble figuring out how to make new grains nucleate in a dynamic recrystallization model with deformation induced nucleation. I am trying to follow the https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/phase_field/Nucleation/DiscreteNucleation.html instructions below:\n\"Direct order parameter modification\n...\nNucleation of new grains in a polycrystalline model with GrainTracker requires the use of reserved (or staging) order parameters (order parameters which the grain tracker detects new grains in, but never uses as a target for remapping) in which new grain nuclei can be inserted and successively get picked up and remapped onto the evolving order parameters.\nApply both a DiscreteNucleationForce and a Reaction kernel to a reserved order parameter and set the hold_time in the inserter to 0. This will cause the modification of the reserved OP during only a single timestep, which will be enough for the GrainTracker to pick up and remap the new nucleus.\"\nFrom that I have made a discrete nucleation inserter which has a rate dependent on the stress as a function of dislocation density and it does make the nuclei as the domain deforms. However, the nuclei just disappear without forming new grains. Is there something missing in this description where I can set a new random euler angle in the nucleus or make sure the relevant non conserved OP goes to 0 or something so a new grain will form?\nI have combined moose/modules/combined/examples/phase_field-mechanics/hex_grain_growth_2D_eldrforce.i with the nucleation inputs in moose/modules/phase_field/examples/nucleation/refine.i which I modified as a test to have a probability linked to the vonmises stress. The probability seems to work fine putting nuclei in reasonable locations they just don't seem to stick...\nThanks,\nJake",

These nuclei don't look spherical and I think the DiscreteNucleationInserter can only insert spherical shapes. So here are a couple of suggestions:\n-Try outputting the nucleation map to an AuxVariable using the DiscreteNucleationAux AuxKernel to see if the positions of these nuclei are in the same position as where the map is putting them\n-Try running without applied stress. Unless the mesh displacement is significantly magnified it looks like there is a very high strain and probably very high elastic energy. It could be that the free energy elastic contribution is so large that it's becoming energetically favorable to form new nuclei in non-zero order parameters.\nAs far as the dump objects problem, I think if you leave the dump path blank it will just show the entire contents of the input file with actions substituted.",

I have successfully compiled Cpp and Gfortran code with it and completed its function calls. But now there is a problem that bothers me, currently I have a Fortran based program, but it can only be compiled by ifort, but when I switch the server to ifort environment, compiling it by using moose's libtool tool will show me an error, whereas when I compile it directly with ifort externally, I won't have any problem. I would like to ask you guys why this is the case.\nMy app is named program. The display of the error report looks like this :\n\nyours,\nJiahuiLv",

What you would need to do in order to set \"initial conditions\" for the old value of _var is to change what's at the end of InitialConditionTempl<T>::compute(). Instead of a call to _var.setDofValue, you would need a call to something like _var.setDofValueOld. That API doesn't currently exist though. If you add it, then I would make it private and make InitialConditionTempl a friend template. We do not want other code to have the ability to modify old values",
