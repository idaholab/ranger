In a 3D model, the velocity is a function of (x, y, z) and I want to know the average velocity at z. This requires an area integral of velocity(x,y,z) on the xy plane, and then dividing by the channel area on the xy plane. Similarly, material properties rho, mu, k, cp are also functions of (x, y, z), and I want to get their average value at coordinate z. What object should be used in MOOSE to accomplish this?",

Obviously, the convective heat transfer coefficient at the fluid-solid interface should be a function of flow conditions (eg velocity):\n\nI want to get htc using Peclet number, and I created a Peclet number in Materials block:\n  [./Pe_fluid]\n    type = ADParsedMaterial\n    f_name = Pe\n    function = 'speed * ${L} / (k / (rho * cp))'\n    material_property_names = 'k rho cp'\n    args = 'speed'\n    block = fluid\n  [../]\n\nNow there is a Pe on each element in the fluid area. In other words, Pe is a function of x and y, that is, Pe=f(x,y). But htc is a function of y. So I want to get the mean of Pe at each y. For sidesets, I only have sidesets of boundaries.

The velocity of the moving boundary (let's say V) is controlled by a coupled variable c (in my example: mass concentration). However, the direction of the movement should be perpendicular to the boundary. Therefore, the boundary-moving function should look something like this:\nX=X0+V(c)* t * [nx, ny, nz],\nwhere [nx, ny, nz] is the normal vector to the boundary at point (x,y,z) and time t.\nIs there a userobject or auxiliary variable in Moose that I can use to find the normal vector? If not, what is your advice?\nBest regards,\nKavan",

But when I try something more like a production-level mesh with 24M nodes and 18M tets, I run into problems. If I try to run --mesh-only to split the mesh, the execution chews on \"Setting Up\" for a long long time (timed out after 24 hrs on 96 MPI tasks). Same hppens if I run with --check-input. This is not a memory problem and I believe it is not specific to the app but rather something goofy in my framework build (all tests run fine, and I have no issues with small or medium sized problems). How can I figure out what gets the system hung up on \"Setting Up\"? It seems to me a mesh with some 24M nodes should not be a big deal if I have enough MPI tasks and memory to go around.\nThanks!",

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone!\nI am using MOOSE to build an application to simulate the transient single-phase flow using three basic equations and several state equations, and now it comes to the final part.\nIn the transient simulation, the oscillation happens near the boundary, leading to not converging at certain time step. So I am trying to use some stablization methods like SUPG used in the NS module.\nThen I look into the NS kernels, finding that there is a basic kernel called ADKernelSUPG which is the base class of many ns kernels, so I am trying to make use of the Kernel to compute the stablization terms.\nHowever, I cannot find tutorial on how to use this kernel for development on the offical website. Could you help me with learning to use ADKernelSUPG and Kernels like that? Like examples or docs and things like that.\nThank you so much!",

Essentially you need to do 3 things:\n\nprovide a material property describing tau\nprovide a vector variable velocity\nimplement precomputeQpStrongResidual. You could do this on a strong term basis, e.g. if you have three terms in your PDE, create three kernels that inherit from ADKernelSUPG. Or you could do something like what is done in INSADEnergySUPG where only one kernel is used to gather the contributions from all terms in the PDE (those contributions are held in a material property _temperature_strong_residual)\n\nStrong term/strong form just means your PDE before you convert it to the weak form for finite element discretization.",

We have a method, libMesh::ExodusII_IO::set_extra_integer_vars(vector<string>), that tells a read() to look for elemental variables with the specified names and read them into our extra-id values.  And Moose has a parameter, exodus_extra_element_integers in FileMeshGenerator, to interface with that from a user input file.  But I haven't really touched that code myself (except to fix a nasty bug that cropped up in it), and it's a bit of a hack (it only works on values which can be represented as both our internal integer dof_id_type and the Exodus float type they're written to), and I'm not sure what it maps to under the hood in the Exodus file.  It'd definitely be worth a try, though.",

The thing is that we do not have any problem with rectangular mesh but encounter with this error in trimesh. Actually we even tried trimesh action with a simple geometry and it still resulted with Segmentation Fault error. We are just trying to find out the way of using trimesh in our case.\nHasan",
