          "bodyText": "Dear researchers and developers,\nthank you guys so much for providing the open-source PLASMA simulation codes. I am a novice in PLASMA research and working hard to complete my doctoral studies.However, due to my poor ability on programming of finite element solvers, it has been hard to complete the simulation code of PLASMA completely on my own. To be honest, I was very excited when I first saw Zapdos. I thought it might help me to supplement my lack of simulation.\nTo get back to the point, I hope to use Zapdos to complete the simulation work in the literature[1], but unfortunately, due to a lack of understanding of the underlying solver, I am unable to make a judgment on whether Zapdos can correctly complete this simulation process. I am eager to receive your answers on the applicability of the Zapdos underlying solver to the simulation of PLASMA flow control actuators. If the work can proceed, I also hope to include the reference of Zapdos in my own paper when publishing articles in the future. Thank you so much. The reference is attached in the email.\nReference\n[1]Kunwar Pal Singh, Subrata Roy; Modeling plasma actuators with air chemistry for effective flow control.

I am assuming you are using Ubuntu 22.10 or 23.04 (non-LTS versions) (reference: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases)? I am only curious if we have to delve into this even more.\nI am making points about the version of GCC you are using due to the non-presence of mpicc as described below. I am not sure if you are wanting to use Conda, or your system compilers?\nWhile setting up my environment, I realized the following occurred in your log:\n\u276f cat configure.log | grep mpicc\nChecking for program /home/lmh/projects/moose/python/peacock/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /home/lmh/miniconda3/envs/moose_old/bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /home/lmh/miniconda3/condabin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/local/sbin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/local/bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/sbin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /sbin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/games/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /usr/local/games/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /snap/bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /snap/bin/mpicc...not found\nChecking for program /home/lmh/projects/moose/petsc/lib/petsc/bin/win32fe/mpicc...not found\n  Unable to find programs ['mpicc'] providing listing of each search directory to help debug\n\nMy concerns:\nChecking for program /home/lmh/miniconda3/envs/moose_old/bin/mpicc...not found\n\nA moose_old Conda environment still lingers among your PATH. Which in and of itself is odd, that 1, it exists when it possibly should not? And 2, should exist and does not contain an mpicc binary. Maybe this directory has been deleted?\nI think the best path forward, is to install the oldest possible moose-mpich moose-tools package we have, and go from there.\nconda config --add channels https://conda.software.inl.gov/archive             # An older channel we do not advertise\nmamba create -n moose_old moose-tools=2021.07.14 moose-mpich python=3.7 cmake  # overwrite `moose_old`\nmamba activate old_mpich\nexport METHODS=opt METHOD=opt MOOSE_JOBS=6                                     #  to speed up the build process\nThis above will install an environment which should work with that older version of PETSc you are trying to build...\nBut as @GiudGiud asked, the absolute best option is to know why you cannot use the latest version of MOOSE?",

You need to provide a system-wide version of MPI instead, so MPI becomes available to libMesh, MOOSE, etc.\nEverything will build fine, because libMesh does not require MPI in order to be built. While actually running MOOSE does. So, the errors you are getting when running tests (running moose), are expected.\nIronically, later versions of these scripts your are running have sanity checks in them to alert you, in the event you try to build libMesh without MPI.\nCreating instructional pages on how to use older versions of MOOSE is a good idea, but would be problematic. We can only go back so far, and unfortunately in your case, you're going back far enough where we were just beginning to use Conda. We made a lot of mistakes creating those packages back then. So we moved them out from the public channel, into a separate 'archive' channel. That is: they cannot coexist in the same public channel (https://conda.software.inl.gov/public). Doing so causes all sorts of conflicting headaches. Basically what I am trying to say is, even if we created instructions on how to use older versions of MOOSE, the version you want would be beyond the scope of what we'd support showing folks how to do.\nFor example, in your case, you need to install a version of Python that has reached end of life (https://endoflife.date/python 3.7 is now EOL as of the end of June). When this happens, some maintainers will go so far as to physically remove packages from Conda-Forge (something we cannot prevent).\nGoing through the instructions I wrote earlier, it would seem all the necessary Conda packages are still available, and everything builds fine for me:\n(testing) [ubuntu-22][~/projects/3rd/moose/test]> ./moose_test-opt -h\nSLEPc Release Version 3.13.3, unknown\n       The SLEPc Team\n    slepc-maint@upv.es\n https://slepc.upv.es\nSee docs/manual.html for help.\n<trimmed>\n\n\n(testing) [ubuntu-22][~/projects/3rd/moose/test]> git rev-parse HEAD\nb57161c312e90a33cf73fcf5f8ce9c0191af6155\n\n\n(testing) [ubuntu-22][~/projects/3rd/moose/test]> mamba list | grep moose\nmoose-mpich               3.3.2                   build_7    https://conda.software.inl.gov/archive\nmoose-tools               2021.07.14       py37hedbaeeb_0    https://conda.software.inl.gov/archive\n\n\n(testing) [ubuntu-22][~/projects/3rd/moose/test]> ./run_tests -j 12\ndgkernels/2d_diffusion_dg.no_additional_rms_distributed ........................

I am using a UMAT where a plastic model is implemented which depends on the  microstructure evolution defined by different functions. To read the initial particle distribution and the thermal parameters I have implemented the UEXTERNALDB subroutine as well.\nMy first approach was to use only one element and compare the results and running times with the same ABAQUS model. The MOOSE simulation took less time to finish  and the results were similar. However, I tried to built the cube with 125 elements and now, the MOOSE model takes hours to finish while ABAQUS only needs some minutes. The problems seem to be in some increments where the simulation takes ages to calculate the Jacobian and the residuals as the outputs are:\nComputing Jacobian...\nComputing initial Residuals....\nHow could it be this massive difference in times between one single element and 125 elements in MOOSE while ABAQUS can manage it much faster? Is there any way to optimise the building of the Jacobian and the calculation of the Residuals?\nAlso, I have tried to run the code with different solver types but there is not a significant difference in time.\nThis is the current input file that I am running:\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n[]\n\n[Mesh]\n  [gen]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 3\n    xmin = -0.5\n    xmax = 0.5\n    ymin = -0.5\n    ymax = 0.5\n    zmin = -0.5\n    zmax = 0.5\n    nx = 5\n    ny = 5\n    nz = 5\n  []\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n  [top_pull]\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    expression = 0.1*t\n  []\n[]\n\n[Modules/TensorMechanics/Master]\n  [all]\n    add_variables = true\n    strain = SMALL\n    incremental = true\n    generate_output = 'stress_xx stress_yy stress_zz stress_xy stress_xz stress_yz strain_xx strain_yy strain_zz strain_xy strain_xz strain_yz'\n\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [y_pull_function]\n    type = FunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = disp_y\n    boundary = top\n    function = top_pull\n  []\n  [x_bot]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_x\n    boundary = left\n    value = 0.0\n  []\n  [y_bot]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_y\n    boundary = bottom\n    value = 0.0\n  []\n  [z_bot]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_z\n    boundary = front\n    value = 0.0\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  # 1. active for umat calculation\n  [umat]\n    type = AbaqusUMATStress\n    constant_properties = '210000 0.3 7e10'\n    plugin = '../plugins/plastic_MESC_UEXTERNALDB'\n    num_state_vars = 300\n    use_one_based_indexing = true\n  []\n  [density]\n    type = GenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'density'\n    prop_values = '7.9e-9'\n  []\n[]\n\n[UserObjects]\n  [uexternaldb]\n    type = AbaqusUExternalDB\n    plugin = '../plugins/plastic_MESC_UEXTERNALDB'\n    execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_END TIMESTEP_BEGIN FINAL'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = 'PJFNK'\n\n  petsc_options = '-snes_ksp_ew'\n  petsc_options_iname = '-ksp_gmres_restart'\n  petsc_options_value = '101'\n\n  line_search = 'none'\n\n  l_max_its = 100\n  nl_max_its = 100\n  nl_abs_tol = 5e-3\n  l_tol = 5e-3\n  start_time = 0.0\n  end_time = 0.5\n  num_steps = 1000\n  dt = 0.001\n[]\n\n\n\n[Outputs]\n  exodus = true\n[]\n\nCheers,\nMiguel",

Is it safe to use this option.\nIs there a way to pass the value to BC but remain preset = true, which is the default option in Nodal BC.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The link here #18380 can be referred for an understanding of the related work.  The material model however was not based upon a crystal plasticity considerations and so my recent work has focussed on selecting the appropriate finite strain CP models in MOOSE that can realistically model the constitutive behaviour at this scale.

The material constitutive model, Crystal Plasticity Kalidini Update will replicate the functionality used in your input file. The ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress system is being actively developed while the FiniteStrainCrystalPlasticity is not.\nWith any of our MOOSE crystal plasticity classes, one must supply an incremental strain calculator class, usually ComputeFiniteStrain. The error you are seeing occurs because only the incremental strain calculator classes provide the deformation gradient, and ComputeSmallStrain is a total strain calculator class which does not compute a deformation gradient. Please see the regression test input file here as an example.\nI would also recommend the use of the TensorMechanicsMaster action, if it will work well with the GlobalStrain. @SudiptaBiswas  and @dschwen  would you please provide guidance here?\nBest Regards,\nStephanie",

I went further ahead with ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress and the kalidindi crystal plasticity model and also included TensormechanicsMasterAction. I've removed the GlobalStrain inside the master block just to make sure it does not mix up with ComputeGlobalStrain.  This looks quite reasonable, however throws the following error.\n\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the object \"MOOSE Problem\", of type \"FEProblem\".\n\nThe following material properties are declared on block 0 by multiple materials:\n  Material Property             Material Objects\n  mechanical_strain             strain stress_div_strain\n  total_strain                  strain stress_div_strain\n\nLooks like mutiple materials are trying to define the strain properties, which might need some trimming here.

At the moment i do not have much idea about the extent of modifications needed for the work (global strain in incremental setting) and so its hard for me to arrive at an approximate time estimate. You might be in a better position to address the requirements and come up with a time frame. Probably you could initiate proceedings and show me the path, i could then see if the implmentation can be taken up parallel to my current work.",
