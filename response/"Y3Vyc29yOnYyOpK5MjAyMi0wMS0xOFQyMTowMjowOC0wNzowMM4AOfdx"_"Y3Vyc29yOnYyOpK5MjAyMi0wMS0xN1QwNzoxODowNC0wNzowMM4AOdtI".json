I encoded a spatial dependence on x, y, z points and made a class that inherits from Function.h. It returns a 0 or 1 to an AuxVariable if conditions are met. If the result is 1, then CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier modifies the subdomain.\nHowever when testing this function, the spatial dependence was nonexistent and it seemed that only the last value of the function was used for the entire mesh.\nI decided to try adapting the code to a new class that inherits from ADMaterial.h. This way each qp can be modified depending on the spatial conditions. However, when using the virtual function computeQpProperties(), I cannot easily use the x, y, z points like I could when using the virtual function value() in a class that inherits from Function.h.\nI cannot use const Point & p as an argument to computeQpProperties. I tried to use libMesh::Point(0), libMesh::Point(1), libMesh::Point(2) as x, y, and z within my virtual function override but I am getting errors such as 'libMesh::TypeVector<T>::TypeVector(const T&, const T&, const T&) [with T = double]' is protected within this context.\nI am not sure how to deal with this issue or whether I am taking the right approach.\nHow can I use spatial data within computeQpProperties?\nIs a material property output even compatible with CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier?\nIs there a better way to structure the output of a function so it has spatial dependence?\nThank you,\nCameron",

In both wells I inject for six month and then produce for the next six month. For time stepping I am using FunctionDT functionality of MOOSE. For example the follwing lines represente my time steps (small time steps when the injection or production starts):\ntime_t = '0 864000 15552000 15552001 16416000 31104000 31104001 31968000 46656000 46656001 47520000 62208000'\ntime_dt= '60 172800 172800 60 172800 172800 60 172800 172800 60 172800 172800'\n\nMy main issue is that in wells my Dirac kernel is fluctiating: 6 month injection and 6 month production. In other words from time 0 to 15552000 (6 month) the flow on the point is for example -2 (injection), whereas from 15552001 to 31104000 (12 month) it is +2 (production). Now, I am wondering how I can make this shift in my dirac kernel. How can I define such a Dirac kernel in MOOSE that follows my times?\nIn advance I very much appreciate any help.",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nAt the Geological Institute of Spain, we have develop several plastic models for soils. These models account that the material is made of porous and relate changes in the relative void space (porosity) to plastic dilatancy, representing dilatant and compactive volume changes. For this reason, it is assumed that any change in mean pressure is accompanied by elastic change in volume which makes the bulk modulus non constant.\nThe yield is a function with elliptical shape, and after yield the material approaches to a consolidation curve that is determined experimentally. See for example (http://docs.itascacg.com/3dec700/common/models/camclay/doc/modelcamclay.html).\nWe would like to code these models in MOOSE. We already studied the doco of TensorMechanics, but we are not sure that ComputeMultipleInelasticStress is going to work for us.\nWhere is a good place to start? And is there a similar code on which we can base ours?\nThanks and regards,\nFernando",

Perhaps you can tell us more detail about why it's not going to work for you.
