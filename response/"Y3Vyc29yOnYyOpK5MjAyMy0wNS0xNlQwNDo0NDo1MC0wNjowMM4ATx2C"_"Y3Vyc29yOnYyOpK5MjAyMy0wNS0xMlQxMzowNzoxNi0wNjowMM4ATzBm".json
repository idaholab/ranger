The MOOSE needs plenty of hours (>30hrs) to finish constructing the mesh as shown below. For this mesh file, there are different blocks that show different Euler angles. I am wondering why this is happening and whether there is a more efficient way of handling the mesh like this.\nThanks.\nMesh..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",

I track the H concentration of the \u03b4-precipitate and \u237a-matrix (i.e., c = c_\u03b4 + c_\u237a) in this KKS model. But I am not quite sure what I should do for the \"DiscreteNucleation\" material and the \"op_names\" input: Should it be 'c_\u03b4 c_\u237a' or just 'c'?  Do both the \u03b4-precipitate and the \u237a-matrix have a Discrete Nucleation material? like fn_\u03b4= p(c_\u03b4-c_\u03b4^eq)^2 and  fn_\u237a= p(c_\u237a-c_\u237a^eq)^2 ?\nThank you!\n-Cloris",

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI am solving a 2D model. The 2D mesh is 30*25 with 5 levels of refinement. My first question is how can I get the number of elements and DOFs with the refined mesh? I am asking this because I think the numbers I got at the output are based on unrefined mesh.\nI also want to know how can I speed up the simulation process. Herein I run the simulation with 94 CPUs, but it is not as fast as I wanted it to be. Moreover, my advisor has a COMSOL model of this simulation which took it like 2 hours to produce results, but mine took me like 15 hours. Based on this and MOOSE parallelism framework, I think there should be a way that I can increase the speed of my simulation! Especially I want to do it also in 3D which is much more time-consuming, so finding a way to speed up the 2D model is essential for me. I would appreciate suggestions by MOOSE experts in this manner. I also attached some information about my model.\nThanks,\nAli\nMOOSE Version:           git commit cb1ac8f on 2023-04-10\nLibMesh Version:         80494219d2293e467392189814d30330c4f87a25\nPETSc Version:           3.16.6\nSLEPc Version:           3.16.2\nCurrent Time:            Sat Apr 22 11:12:53 2023\nExecutable Timestamp:    Sat Apr 22 10:44:09 2023\n\nParallelism:\n  Num Processors:          94\n  Num Threads:             1\n\nMesh: \n  Parallel Type:           replicated\n  Mesh Dimension:          2\n  Spatial Dimension:       2\n  Nodes:                   \n    Total:                 806\n    Local:                 15\n    Min/Max/Avg:           0/17/8\n  Elems:                   \n    Total:                 750\n    Local:                 8\n    Min/Max/Avg:           7/8/7\n  Num Subdomains:          1\n  Num Partitions:          94\n  Partitioner:             metis\n\nNonlinear System:\n  Num DOFs:                4030\n  Num Local DOFs:          75\n  Variables:               { \"vel_x\" \"vel_y\" \"p\" \"c\" \"w\" } \n  Finite Element Types:    \"LAGRANGE\" \n  Approximation Orders:    \"FIRST\" \n\nAuxiliary System:\n  Num DOFs:                5362\n  Num Local DOFs:          70\n  Variables:               { \"x_coor\" \"y_coor\" } { \"jump\" \"error\" \"F\" \"mu\" \"rho\" } \n  Finite Element Types:    \"LAGRANGE\" \"MONOMIAL\" \n  Approximation Orders:    \"FIRST\" \"CONSTANT\" \n\nExecution Information:\n  Executioner:             Transient\n  TimeStepper:             ConstantDT\n  TimeIntegrator:          ImplicitEuler\n  Solver Mode:             NEWTON\n  PETSc Preconditioner:    asm \n  MOOSE Preconditioner:    SMP",
