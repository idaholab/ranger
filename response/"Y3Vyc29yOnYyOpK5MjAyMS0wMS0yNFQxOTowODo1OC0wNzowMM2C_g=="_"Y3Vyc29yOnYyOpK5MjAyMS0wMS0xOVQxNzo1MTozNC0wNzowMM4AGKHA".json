Just to be clear: with the old solver setup, it converges on your laptop but not on hpc, is this correct?

The only VTK we distribute ourselves is for use by libMesh's VTK support (moose-libmesh-vtk).\n@abarun22 Conda does not distribute OpenGL, or mesa (not the mesa we're all thinking. Mesa3d is the product of that error). Conda's VTK simply uses whats available on the machine. If the version available on the machine is too old, you may see a message like that. You are correct in trying to get an older version.\nUnfortunately after digging a little, I'm afraid VTK 7.1.1 was only ever built with PyQt 4 (while Peacock requires 5). The errors you are receiving I believe are due to that machine needing a newer implementation of OpenGL and/or Mesa just as the VTK error suggests...",

          "bodyText": "Hello, I am trying to understand how mpiexec -n <num_procs> and --n-threads=<num_threads> are translated when submitting jobs on INL HPC through the PBS system.\nOne thing is clear to me: num_procs is set by -l select=<num_nodes>:ncpus=<num_cores>:mpiprocs=<num_procs>.\nHowever, I'm not sure how shared memory works on Falcon. Particularly, what the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable does. If I don't set it, than the default is num_cores, which I think implies 1 thread/core, which is generally what I want. However, the MOOSE job script example on the HPC website (https://hpcweb.hpc.inl.gov/software/open_speedshop/) sets OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 even though ncpus=24:mpiprocs=8, so this confuses me.\nOne other thing I'm concerned about is the MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY environment variable. If this variable is enabled (default), I get a warning about slow performance when OMP_NUM_THREADS is non-zero (meanwhile zero isn't even a valid input). I read online that you generally want to disable affinity when hyper-threading so that you don't accidentally send too many threads to any one proc. But I also read that enabling affinity is great for single-threaded processes, which again, is generally what I want.\nI guess my question is the following: How should I set the OMP_NUM_THREADS and MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY environment variables if I don't want to use shared memory, i.e., if I want --n-threads=1, when running a MOOSE app on Falcon cluster? My guess is OMP_NUM_THREADS=<num_procs> and MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=0",
