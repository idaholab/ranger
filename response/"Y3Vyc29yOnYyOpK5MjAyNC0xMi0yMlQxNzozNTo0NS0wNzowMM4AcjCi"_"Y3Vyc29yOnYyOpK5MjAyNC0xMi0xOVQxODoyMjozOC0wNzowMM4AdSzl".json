          "bodyText": "Check these boxes if you have followed the posting rules.\n\n Q&A General is the most appropriate section for my question\n I have consulted the posting Guidelines on the Discussions front page\n I have searched the Discussions forum and my question has not been asked before\n I have searched the MOOSE website and the documentation does not answer my question\n I have formatted my post following the posting guidelines (screenshots as a last resort, triple back quotes around pasted text)\n\nQuestion\nHello everyone,\nI am trying to use the JouleHeatingSource to Calculate the heat source term corresponding to electrostatic Joule heating for an underground power cable. The given example Inputfile on the Moose-website runs with a given voltage value (BC) for the left and right boundary of a simple 2d copperplate geometry.\n(https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/JouleHeatingSource.html)\nIn general:\nIs it possible to use a given current value instead of a voltage value for the elec variable, to calculate the heat source term?\nWhat is the output unit of the Joule Heating Source or the variable elec --> I assumed [W] ???\nI tried applying the example Inputfile on to my cable geometry (simple 2D circle, generated with Gmsh) where I defined a physical point as a point-source (e.g. 0.1 V) and an outer boundary circle with 0 V. The material properties are assigned to the created surface, see mesh & Inputfile below. (Pleas let me know if the Link doesn't work.)\nhttps://github.com/AgentKTU/JH-Power-cable.git\nUsing this approach I get a calculated temperature of 700 K at the outer boundary, that doesn't seem realistic.\nI tried saving the output of the JouleHeatingSource with   save_in = var. (see AuxVariable in input file) but the results aren't reasonable. The var values are all negativ.\nWhat is the assumed unit or value of the JouleHeatingModule???\nMy goal is to export the value of the Power loss (the heat source term) and implement it to my PorousFlow soil model where I added a heat source boundary.\nAt the end I want to simulate the temperature distribution in the soil by defining realistic boundary conditions and see how the cable temperature reacts.\nI am happy about any help!\nKonstantin",

So, the heat source $q$ that we're adding to the PDE using JouleHeatingSource is:\n$q = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\sigma \\cdot \\nabla \\phi \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$\nwith standard SI units of Watts per meters-cubed. The variable elec used in the object would normally be in units of Volts. We don't make explicit assumptions on units in many MOOSE objects, so as long as you are consistent in your input file, we don't impose a specific unit system on you.\nTo go back to the question of whether we can use a current value or not, I cannot think of an alternative off the top of my head that you could use with the right mathematical form. @GiudGiud do you have a thought on this? Maybe we're lucky, and I missed it in the EM module and the framework when I looked through just now. In any case, your residual comtribution (in computeQpResidual) for such an object would need to be something like:\n-_current[_qp] * (-_grad_elec[_qp]) * _test[_i][_qp];\n\nWhere you have a new object parameter to represent your coupled current value (if a variable), or the function / material property form that you might use to compute it otherwise.",

For example:\n\nSince I don't use Conda for anything else, I did delete it and reinstalled miniconda.\nI then was trying to follow the MOOSE installation instructions. I came upon one error that said there was no livereload channel, so I downloaded that.\n\n\nWe don't have anything among our documentation that says \"miniconda\" anymore.\nlivereload comes with modern moose-dev, because moose-dev installs moose-tools. And moose-tools contains livereload\n\nMy guess is that the instructions @charlotte-b8086 are not precisely the ones found at: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/conda.html",

Was the original problem that my WASP/libmesh packages were not synced up so I had to make those synced? It would be good to know how to recognize this issue in the future and prevent it from happening.\nIn general, do you have any recommendations on how one gets better at MOOSE?",

And the factor in wall-time is reasonable considering I only have 32980 DOF in my non-linear system and 5 CPUs is probably a bit much. So far so good.\nBut the numbers on memory-consumption is not clear to me:\n\nwith 1 CPU Moose writes below the performance graph \"438 MB\" - in the performance graph \"291 MB\" is written\nwith 5 CPUs Moose writes below the performance graph \"249 MB\" - in the performance graph \"106 MB\" is written\n\nMore in detail:\n\nWhy does the memory consumption given in the performance graph and below is off by factor 1.5, 2.3?\nWhy is the memory consumption with 5 CPUs smaller than with 1? Is the memory consumption written per CPU and I have to multiply by the number of CPUs used?\n\nThank you in advance!",

You'll have to do precisely the following:\nDownload the patch file (attached), and save it to the root of your MOOSE repository. Apply the patch like so:\ncd ~/projects/moose\npatch -p1 < memory_logger.patch\nNext, run the memory_logger as so, on a test file, just to see if it works (replace YOU with your actual user name):\ncd ~/projects/moose/test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion\n~/projects/moose/scripts/memory_logger.py --run 'mpiexec -n 5 /home/YOU/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i /home/YOU/projects/moose/test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion/simple_diffusion.i -r 5'\nThen do what the program explains to do when it finishes. If this works, we can then concentrate on how to run this on your actual problem. It should ask you to do something like the following:\n~/projects/moose/scripts/memory_logger.py --read /home/YOU/projects/moose/test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion/memory.log\nNote: pay carful attention to the command line arguments after --run. You need to supply absolute paths to everything. No relative paths (no use of ~/ or $HOME etc.\nmemory_logger.patch",

I have utilized the timeperiod functionality within the control module to dynamically set the material properties within a certain block. Specifically, I aim for the same material within the same block to have three different property values across three distinct time periods. Therefore, I have configured each timeperiod to enable the corresponding material property while attempting to disable the other two.\nHowever, during actual simulation runs, I have observed that one of the material properties remains consistently enabled. Even when I explicitly specify to disable it within a certain timeperiod, it stays enabled.",

The output at the last time step of 0.5s before I change the input file shows mat4 and mat5 enabled, and mat1 disabled, which is the same as the material enabled at time 0 to 0.4s.
