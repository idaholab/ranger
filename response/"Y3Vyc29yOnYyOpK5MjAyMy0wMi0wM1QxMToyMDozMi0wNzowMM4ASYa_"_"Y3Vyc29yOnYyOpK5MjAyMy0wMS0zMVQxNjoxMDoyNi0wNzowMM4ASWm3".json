To more easily measure model distortions, the mesh is kept centered by applying constraints that force the displacements of certain nodes (corner nodes for example) to sum to zero. In Abaqus you can also explicitly set the rotational degrees of freedom to zero so there is no rigid body motion.\nI have written a NodalKernel for MOOSE that does the mesh centering, but some rotation can still occur. Is there a way I can prevent rotations without pinning nodes?",

Now, the solution is expected to have a different convergence rate as the scalar value (alpha) changes. It should converge to the same solution though with a different number of iterations. I am getting that my solution converges in two iterations for all values of alpha. This is weird. Please what could I do to achieve a different convergence rate as the alpha changes, and for it to converge to the same true solution at every single time?\nMore specifically, the idea is to have the solutions transferred to and from each subdomain at every step of the iteration until convergence. Currently, I think the right subdomain solves and send the result to the left. Then the left sub uses those values in its calculation and output the result. That's the two iterations. How can I make the results to be sent back and forth until convergence?\nThank you!\n-----------------------------\nRight Subdomain\n-------------------------------\n[Mesh]\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n

I think it is problem specific\nBy reformulating the BC, this is what I did:\n\nSo, I implemented the first equation in my left subdomain and the second in the right subdomain, paying attention to the signs coming from the fluxes from the two subdomains. The left side of the equations is implemented as the robin/vacuum BC, while the right sides are from the transferred values. The idea is that as the lambda and the alpha change, the solution should converge at different rates to achieve the same result. Note that the lambda and the alpha are the iteration parameters.",

However, others, such as time step size, and number of cores used are less obvious.\nI would like to understand how the above factors affect memory usage, as well as any others which may be significant (For instance, I am guessing number of kernels has an effect?).\nHopefully this will help improve things whilst the search for a more appropriate preconditioner continues!\nThanks!",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI was running a MultiApps problem,  main app is a heat conduction problem, and sub app is a simple lumped parameter problem. The calculation process is that main app uses the initial temperature boundary conditions to calculate steady-state heat conduction, after that, the integrate heat flux is postprocessed at the boundary and then transfer to the sub app to calculate and update the boundary temperature and continue the iteration.\nI set Picard iteration in the [Executioner] block, use the default fixed_point_rel_tol, and set fixed_point_min_its to 2. The calculation converge in the second picard iteration, and the results look reasonable; However, when I set fixed_point_min_its to larger (10), it still converges after the tenth picard iteration, but the result is different and extremely unreasonable.\nSo I have two questions:\n\nSeems Picard iteration is not converged from the calculation results, then why it showed solve converged?\nWhat parameters can be adjusted to improve the convergence of iteration? I've tried to set relaxation_factor to <1, and also refine the mesh or reduce the tolerance to enhanced convergence, but still no improvement.\n\nAny guidance is greatly appreciated!",

Everything else only deals with how converged the result should be.\nOther fixed point iteration algorithms are more brittle than Picard as well\nGuillaume",
