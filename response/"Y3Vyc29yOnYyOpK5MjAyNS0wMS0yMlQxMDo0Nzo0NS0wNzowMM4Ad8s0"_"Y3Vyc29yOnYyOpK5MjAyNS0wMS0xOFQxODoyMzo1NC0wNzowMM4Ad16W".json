I chose this nozzle just for validation and next step is to simulate straight cylinder and similar other geometries where the flow would be driven predominatly by pressure differences involving slight density changes/weakly compressible or incompressible flows\na) /home/arsad/projects/moose/modules/navier_stokes/test/tests/finite_volume/cns/stagnation_inlet. Using the input file shown above, I wanna simulate my own cd nozzle 'nozzle.msh' for AIR and Argon. The nozzle boundaries are labeled as INFLOW, OUTFLOW and WALL. Do I have option of simulating only half geometry (axisymmetric  nozzle). Also, I wanna impose pressure inlet 1mT and in another case flow rate inlet 10 sccm. How can I do it? The relevant tutorials didn't help.\nb) Then simulate straight cylinder for above cases.\nIf could answer both the question, that would be much appreciated!",

I ran the TH model without any problems, but when I added the M component, it did not converge anymore. Now I reduced the problem to HM.\nCurrently, if I remove the PorousFlowMassVolumetricExpansion kernel, the simulation runs but I don't understand why or if it makes sense. As far as I understand, this kernel lumps the mass component (that is in the quadrature point) into the nodes right? And that is necessary for the computation of the Time derivatives (mass in this case) as they are evaluated in the nodes, therefore, the mass calculations might not be correct.\nCan somebody help me?

Based on your recommendation, I downloaded and studied Cardinal which is a coupling process between OpenMC and NekRs in MOOSE, so I have the following questions:\n\nMy neutronics program is different from OpenMC in that it is a deterministic method. Does this mean that I also need to create a MOOSE grid, and then map the MOOSE grid to the physical and thermal grids before I can call the internal modules of MOOSE, such as transfer\nIf the above behavior is really needed, how can I perform the grid mapping work?",

MOOSE (/libMesh) has routines for projecting onto MOOSE variables (see the GeneralField Transfers or ProjectionTransfer or NearestLocation Transfer for an example)\nYour code should have something similar to set a field from a MOOSE field (there are routines in MOOSE to get the value at a certain position)",

Here's a suggestion on how to implement this:\n\n\nUse GrainTracker: The GrainTracker can be used to track the grains and interfaces. In your case, you could define an interface as a region where more than one order parameter is active, indicating the presence of two grains in contact.\n\n\nDefine Interface vs. Bulk: You can set up logic to distinguish between the bulk and the interface based on the number of active order parameters at a given integration point. If only one order parameter is active, it indicates a bulk point, and if multiple order parameters are active, it indicates an interface.\n\n\nAssign Material Properties: Once you have identified the bulk and interface regions, you can assign different material properties based on this classification.\n\n\nLet me know if you need more details or specific examples for your setup!\nWei",

Specifically, when running the simulation for a time step t=1, it takes around 4021.53s on my server for the 3D case. On the other hand, when I reduce the problem to 2D, the same simulation step only takes 27.78s.\nGiven this, I would like to know what aspects of my input file I should focus on optimizing to improve the computational efficiency of the 3D simulation. Any suggestions on specific parameters, solvers, or techniques that could help speed up the calculation would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you in advance for your insights!\nBest regards,\nWei",

(Even when calculating up to t=0.01, it takes 115.82s, and the output to the terminal is\uff1a 02_3d_split_noAdaptivity.txt\n. Moreover, using mesh adaptivity, the time consumption is 426.74s.\n\nRe partitioning is expensive so it can be a good idea to use a prior simulation mesh (using the checkpoint system, not using exodus) as the starting point.\n\nSorry, I don\u2019t quite understand using the checkpoint system, not using exodus. I didn\u2019t output the checkpoint file for recovery in [Outputs], but only the Nemesis-type file.\n\nHere you only have two crystals right? So not very many order parameters. That's usually impactful but not here.\n\nYes, there are only two order parameters here, as well as two conservative field variables cv (to distinguish vapor and bulk) and w. This case is a very simple bicrystal model, used to verify the reliability and efficiency of the model.\n\nSolver wise PJFNK with block jacobi is probably a weak option.\n\nWhy is using the PJFNK solver with block Jacobi considered a weak option? Apologies for my lack of experience and theoretical knowledge regarding the [Executioner] module settings. If there are good practical summaries or learning materials on this, I would appreciate it if you could share them with me.\n\nTry to look into Newton if you have enough memory and a perfect Jacobian, and try to use a different preconditioner.\n\nGot it. Based on your suggestion, I set the solve type to Newton, and indeed, this method is faster, taking only 86.6s. Additionally, I noticed that there are several options in the Preconditioning System such as Split, FDP, PSP, PBP, SMP, and VCP. I will try these further tomorrow. Thanks for your advice on this.\n\nWhy are you using vinewton for the snes type? Do you have constraints?\n\nActually, I just copied an example from Moose, although I don\u2019t fully understand what it means. Maybe I should add some knowledge about PETCs. Do you have any other advice on this?\nFinally, I greatly appreciate your valuable suggestions. I will further understand and try the adjustments based on your responses, and I hope you can provide further guidance.\nWei\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust anything!",

I have successfully compiled the code, but the simulation has aborted with a \"Segmentation fault (signal 11)\" message. I have also tried to debug the code using GDB (example 21), but I haven't got any useful information.\nThe total strain is expressed as: \u03f5total = \u03f5elastic + \u03f5thermal + \u03f5chemical.\nFor thermal strain: \u03f5thermal = CTE(T-Tref), where CTE = cte_curedp + cte_uncured(1-p), where cte_cured and cte_uncured are two constants, and p is an ADMaterialProperty variable.\nFor chemical strain: \u03f5chemical = \u03f5chemical_max*p, where \u03f5chemical_max is a constant.\nThe Young's modulus varies with the ADMaterialProperty variable p, the relationship can be expressed as: E = Ecexp(bp), where Ec is the base Young's modulus and b is the exponential factor.\nI have developed two classes: CureDependentIsotropicElasticity (based on #22587) and ChemicalThermalEigenStrain.

Maybe the bottom boundary extends beyond block 1?\n\nSince we can solve two steps, I checked the bottom boundary, the bottom was correct. The problem might come from adaptivity as the mesh changed after time = 0.1. I would try a uniform fixed mesh later.\nFollowing your suggestion, I created a new sideset using ParsedGenerateSideset. The results were the same after I replaced all \"bottom\" with the newly created \"bottom_of_block_1\".\nTime Step 0, time = 0\n\nTime Step 1, time = 0.1, dt = 0.1\n\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\n\n Solve Converged!\n\nTime Step 2, time = 0.2, dt = 0.1\n Solve Converged!\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)",
