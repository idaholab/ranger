Just like RELAP5:\n\nusing six-equation model;\nusing the closure model in RELAP5;\nusing the RDG method and Roe-type numerical method to solve convection terms;\nusing water97 fluid properties;\nusing the component framework in THM, and developing the two-phase components.\n\nIf it is possible? I'm not sure.....  Could anyone kindly tell me? Or I must develop our own code using the seven-equation model like RELAP7?",
