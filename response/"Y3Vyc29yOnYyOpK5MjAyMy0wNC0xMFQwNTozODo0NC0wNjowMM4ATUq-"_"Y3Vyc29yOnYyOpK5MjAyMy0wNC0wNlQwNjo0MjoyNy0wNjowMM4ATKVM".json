and bottom, but they were not defined separately; both upper and lower boundaries were amalgamated as bottom and had the same id. Looking up intermediate meshes from top_side and bot_side, top_side had top boundary set and bot_side had bottom boundary set and they did share the same id.\nI thought their ids were not shifted properly since bot_side and top_side parallel to each other(in terms of meshing hierarchy) so I tried my last approach before posting this discussion:\n\n[Mesh]\n    [hex]\n        type =

sideset from top_side2 with removal using replace=True option so that I don't have  two bottom surfaces: one in bot_side and another in top_side2. However, I ended up having removal surface to overlap with bottom surface in top_side2 block.\nIs there anything I am missing or any other approach I can take here?\nSystem Specifications\nOS: OSX with 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9\nMOOSE revision: 713b8ad\nPython version: 3.8.15\nMOOSE package versions:\nmoose-libmesh             2023.03.02              build_0    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-libmesh-vtk         9.1.0               hfa13f3c_17    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-mpich               4.0.2                   build_7    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-petsc               3.16.6                  build_6    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-pyhit               2022.03.15       py38hf789992_1    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-test-tools          2023.02.13       py38h4ff14f2_0    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-tools               2023.02.13       py38h4ff14f2_0    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public\nmoose-wasp                1.0.0                   build_0    https://conda.software.inl.gov/public",

Considering this, It is a two phase model which has a liquid phase which has water properties on the left block and a liquid which it viscosity is mu(p, S) on the right block. So, when gas is injected from the left, the right fluid has a constant viscosity until gas reaches to the right block. I thought that maybe assigning same phase to both these liquid is the problem but as I checked this is not the reason. Also model works when a constant viscosity is assigned to the right liquid.",
