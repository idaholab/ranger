Trying to mix CPU assembly with GPU solve gets hobbled by RAM->VRAM bandwidth on most architectures, so we really want GPU assembly too.  (although, it's been forever since I tested that; I should see how the $LIBMESH_BENCHMARK run goes if I just set -vec_type and -mat_type...)\nMy original libMesh-on-GPUs experiment used VexCL, which was fantastic for everything it did but which doesn't let you go to completely general kernels without ending up writing raw GPU code anyway.  A colleague in a GPGPU-intensive job tells me that the most popular alternatives today are (oversimplifying and paraphrasing): Kokkos (which nobody likes), CUDA (which is slightly less ugly but cuts your hardware compatibility in half), or CUDA+HIP (which is slightly less ugly but twice as much work).  I did some playing with the Nvidia HPC SDK a year or so ago, and that amazingly lets you write a lot of GPGPU code via \"C++17 plus a magic compiler flag\" on recent Nvidia cards, but IIRC when I dropped that I'd already reported two showstopper bugs and one of them hadn't yet been fixed.",

          "bodyText": "Today, I updated my MOOSE version from 2023.8.24 to 2023.10.29 using conda. After the update, my program started throwing an error:\nAssertion `neighbor' failed\nShould be non-null\n\nHowever, the same input cards worked perfectly fine in the older version of MOOSE (I have saved the old version and tested it again). Based on the debugger information, I identified the corresponding code:\n_face_info = _mesh.faceInfo(_current_elem, _current_side);\nif (!_face_info)\n{\n  const Elem * const neighbor = _current_elem->neighbor_ptr(_current_side);\n  mooseAssert(neighbor, \"Should be non-null\");\n  const auto neighbor_side = neighbor->which_neighbor_am_i(_current_elem);\n  _face_info = _mesh.faceInfo(neighbor, neighbor_side);\n  mooseAssert(_face_info, \"We need to have retrieved something.\");\n}\n\nThis code is part of a new material class derived from the existing PiecewiseConstantByBlockMaterial class in MOOSE. The current function where the code resides is entirely from PiecewiseConstantByBlockMaterial, and I haven't made any modifications. According to the information on the MOOSE website, PiecewiseConstantByBlockMaterial is designed for finite volume methods, but I was able to use it without any issues in my finite element code before. How can I resolve this problem?",
