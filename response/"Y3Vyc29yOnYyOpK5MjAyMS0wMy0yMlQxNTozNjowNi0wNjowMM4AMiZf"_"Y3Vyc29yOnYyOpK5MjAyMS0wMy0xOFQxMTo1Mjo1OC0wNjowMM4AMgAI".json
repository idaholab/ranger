          "bodyText": "I'm solving a system of coupled equations (heat + diffusion) for a system of concentric rings. There is a gap between the rings, which I would rather not model, that leads to a difference in temperature between the inner-right and outer-left boundaries of the rings. I can specify these as a Dirichlet boundary condition (time-dependent function). I also have a relationship that defines the concentration at either side of the interface as a function of the temperature.\nDo I need to use XFEM to model something like this?  If so, how would I specify a function-based Dirichlet boundary condition, and how would I specify an equilibrium relationship across the boundary?",

The \"time\" in these simulations isn't a real time, but is simply to help you divide up the mining excavations into stages.  Eg, set dt=1, and in the first timestep you mine stage 1, in the next timestep you mine stage 2, etc.  So the notion of \"time\" essentially allows you to do your \"for loop\" idea.\nAn associated advantage is that you can, if you wish, shove in some time-derivative kernels, and solve the dynamic problem (you'll probably need damping), which can help with convergence when you've got complicated plasticity, and you can use an explicit method if you like.",

But if people are still using gcc 7.2 and if it's responsible for this build failure then perhaps I'm being too optimistic?  gcc 7 is supposed to have full C++17 support too, in theory, but in practice here we are.",

For example in materials/PebbleBedKappaSolid.C\nFor the inheritance question, I think maybe the thing to do is to have all these utility functions be member functions of a class, and have the ADMaterial you are creating inherit from that class. Pronhorn does that for all the closures that are similar and sharing utility functions.\nJust separate utility functions can also work.\nBest,\nGuillaume",
