Normal physics.\nIn addition to this field variable, I would like to learn some localized physics (say, 'var_local'), whose residual depends on the field variable (its local value, _T[_qp], and gradient, _grad_T[_qp]) and the local variable (some_var), but not its gradient (_grad_some_var[_qp], which does not have physical meaning, neither we should care). Clearly, this 'var_local' lives on each mesh node (and q point).\nThis 'var_local', depending on user request, could be a single value, or an array. This seems to me should be handled by scalar variable type of approach, but current scalar variable does not seem to support this type of specialized request.\nAny suggestions/discussions?",

Sorry that I didn't get back to this reply earlier, I am still more used to watch the email list.\nBack to your reply, no, this is not what I would like to implement. 'var_local' is indeed a variable (or variable array), and it has its own residual form. I have explored what currently moose provides and found similar implementations (e.g., ArrayKernal and NodalKernel), and it seems to me that a new class (e.g., ArrayNodalKernal) will do the job. I will work on it, and see how it goes, and maybe in a later time contribute it back to moose framework.",

So Dirichlet BC has been used for constructing the test and the trial functions, which we define in the input file. However, my concern was more on the boundary term, $\\int_{\\Gamma_n}whdA$. This $h$ is the Newmann boundary condition, if I am not wrong so does it has to be defined in the BC or as an additional term in the kernel or it is within preComputeQPResidual?\nAnd I understand, its always difficult to put things crisp and crystal clear for everyone but the documentation of moose has done a good job.",

The settings for one problem may not be the best for another. Some of these parameters are pretty strait-forward to users like type, end_time, dt.  Some are intermediate like l_max_its, l_tol, nl_max_its, nl_rel_tol, nl_abs_tol, optimal_iterations, cutback_factor, growth_factor. Some are difficult like scheme, solve_type, petsc_options_iname, petsc_options_value. It is worthwhile to spend some time on the parameter documentations.",
