hs@huangsen:~/projects/moose/modules/tensor_mechanics$ \n\nThis looked normal, and I suspected that I didn't have a successful link to tensor mechanics in my twc. so I found a couple example inputfiles in tensor mechanics and ran them with tensor mechanics-opt and twc-opt respectively. Unsurprisingly: the former ran successfully and the latter returned the following\n*** ERROR ***\nA 'TestNewmarkTI' is not a registered object.\n\nIf you are trying to find this object in a dynamically loaded library, make sure that\nthe library can be found either in your \"Problem/library_path\" parameter or in the\nMOOSE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.\n\nIt should be noted that the above is only one example, not only \"TestNewmarkTI\", but also other examples will report \"RankTwoTensorAux\" is not a registered object, or  \"Gravity\" is not a registered object..........\nI've tried to solve the above problem by recreating a new app, reinstalling moose and reinstalling the linux system, but I've encountered this problem with all of them.\nAt the moment I decided to ask the question I made one last attempt, I set ALL_MODULES := yes in the makefile and then make -j 8 again. and then found that the inpufile pasted into the twc folder from all the other module folders also had this problem.\nCan anyone help me please? Any suggestion will be much appreciated.",

After following the steps for staying up-to-date here, I encountered a series of errors when trying to build any app with the Navier Stokes module enabled in the Makefile. The errors all looked something like this:\nIn file included from /Users/opaice/Documents/moose_projects/moose/modules/navier_stokes/build/unity_src/executioners_Unity.C:2:\n/Users/opaice/Documents/moose_projects/moose/modules/navier_stokes/src/executioners/SIMPLE.C:929:19: error: no matching member function for call to 'solve'\n  pressure_solver.solve(mmat, mmat, solution, rhs);\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~\n/Users/opaice/mambaforge3/envs/moose/libmesh/include/libmesh/petsc_linear_solver.h:155:3: note: candidate function not viable: requires 5 arguments, but 4 were provided\n  solve (SparseMatrix<T> & matrix_in,\n  ^\n\nTo be sure it wasn't anything in my existing apps causing the issues, I created a new app just test this and the problem persisted.\nI also tried building in a 'vanilla' environment as described here, which also didn't solve the problem.\nThe line where pressure_solver is defined is:\n  // Fetch the linear solver from the system\n  PetscLinearSolver<Real> & pressure_solver = libMesh::cast_ref<PetscLinearSolver<Real> &>(*pressure_system.get_linear_solver());\n\nSo it seems that whichever solver is being fetched is mismatched with the arguments we later try and give to it. I wonder if I somehow have the wrong version of petsc installed?\nI am curious whether anyone else sees this behaviour or if it's something I've done wrong in the update.\nAny ideas are welcome - thanks!",
