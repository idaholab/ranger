I noticed that the ADViscoplasticityStressUpdate material already has this model incorporated (ADViscoplasticityStressUpdate.C). After reviewing the article linked on the MOOSE Source Page V Tvergaard and A Needleman. Analysis of the cup-cone fracture in a round tensile bar. Acta Metallurgica, 32(1):157\u2013169, 1984.; Reference 5, I am having a little trouble understanding what Lines 188 through 192 are accomplishing when calculating the residual. It appears that there is an extra term when comparing this to Equation 2.2 in the reference (although I am likely overlooking something):\n if (_pore_shape == PoreShapeModel::SPHERICAL) { residual *= 1.0 + _intermediate_porosity / 1.5;  _derivative *= 1.0 + _intermediate_porosity / 1.5; }\n\nAlso, after reviewing the source code for this material, it appears that (relative to the article provided), void nucleation has not been incorporated? (No worries if it has not as it appears fairly straight forward to incorporate).\nThank you,\n-Garrett",

The error is :\n*** ERROR ***\nA 'StressSpectral' is not a registered object.\n\n'StressSpectral.C' file and 'StressSpectral.h' file are created by myself.\n\nHere is what I do:\n- copy the .C file to newapp/src/kernels\n- copy the .h file to newapp/include/kernels\n- do 'make clean' to the app\n- then recomplie my newapp with 'make -j 4'\n\nI can see that the app recompiled with 'StressSpectral.C' file and 'StressSpectral.h' file.\nAfter the recompiling was finished, I tried to run an example from moose (crack2d.i in combined modulus) and it worked well.\nBut when I try to run another input file with StressSpectral.C and StressSpectral.h in the new app, I got this error:\nA 'StressSpectral' is not a registered object.\nDo you have any idea about how to solve this problem?\nThank you.",
