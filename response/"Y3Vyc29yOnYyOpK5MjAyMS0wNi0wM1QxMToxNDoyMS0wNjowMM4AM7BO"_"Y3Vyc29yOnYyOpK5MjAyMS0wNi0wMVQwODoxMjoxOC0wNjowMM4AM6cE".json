I should probably update my MOOSE, if that helps.",

Unfortunately I don't see either of the listed references there and it looks like this input file pre-dated the documentation system anyways. The person who added this input file no longer works at INL so I'm afraid it might not be that easy to track down this reference.\nThe error you are getting indicates you need to update your PetSC library and likely MOOSE as well.",

I've tried using polynomials, which allows me larger time-steps and faster convergence but then these fluctuations keeps happening until I reach c~10^2 and then it crashes. I use adaptivity (mesh is quite refined in the problematic areas).\nNow, I think I would like to try to constrain the concentration, i.e:\nif (_c[qp] > 1) {\n_c[qp] = 1\n}\nWhich I think I could include in any kernel, as long as I call for and initialize the concentration variable. However I'm quite new still with Moose, so I would value any suggestions.\nThanks in advance,\nSouzan",

For example this is a good one:\nmoose/modules/phase_field/examples/cahn-hilliard/Parsed_SplitCH.i\nThat can help you figure out if the problem lies with the governing equations in your input file. I would then try modifying the free energy in the example file to the polynomial form you want to use, then try the logarithmic form, to see if you can isolate whether the free energy is causing troubles. I would also try simulations without the NeumannBC at first, that may be causing solute to be added into the simulation domain and driving it away from two-phase coexistence. You mentioned that c~100 at the end, if it is that large everywhere in the domain that may be caused by the NeumannBC.",

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI am fairly new to using the XFEM module in MOOSE, and I've been running some of the test simulations as well as some of my own. However, I'm a little confused about some of the parameters in the example input files, especially in relation to the  crack propagation and initiation theory presented in the paper Jiang et al. 2020 in Eng. Frac. Mech.\nWith regards to the 'crack_growth_increment parameter', is this the amount of distance the crack is prescribed to grow each time the crack propagation criterion is satisfied? However I notice I can also propagate the crack without this parameter.\nThen in XFEMRankTwoTensorMarkerUserObject, I am a little confused about the 'threshold'. Is this a scalar quantity equivalent to the fracture strength described in the paper mentioned above for crack initiation (section 5.2) which we use when there are no prescribed cracks apriori, or is this part of the crack propagation criterion? I was under the impression that the propagation criterion is that of maximum hoop stress and don't immediately see how this is related to a threshold value.\nThank you very much for the help,\nEnrique",

It definitely reminds us to get those codes merged as soon as we can.\nYou are correct that the crack propagation criterion was based on maximum hoop stress in that paper. And the maximum hoop stress is obtained by evaluating the stress intensity factors. In MOOSE, XFEMRankTwoTensorMarkerUserObject uses a different simple criterion where the crack propagates if the crack tip element stress exceeds a threshold and the direction is determined as the maximum principal direction.\nRegarding the crack_growth_increment, this parameter specifies the amount of distance the crack will grow when crack propagation criterion is met. Without providing this parameter, crack will only propagate one element per time.\nLet us know if you have more questions.",

I ran, per the instructions, the following command:\ndocker run -ti herter4171/ubuntu-moose:latest /bin/bash -c 'cd test; ./run_tests'\nThe result was a failure due to the pyhit module.\nMessage: \"failed to import pyhit - try running \"make hit\" in the $MOOSE_DIR/test directory.\"\nI have tried to troubleshoot this with making the hit target in both the $MOOSE_DIR/test directory and the $MOOSE_DIR/framework/contrib/hit directory.\nThis has been a persistent problem of late with running the image on Windows 10. I am reluctant to try the newer container on my Linux host system for fear of messing with an older, working version.

Since it is merged this morning, the fix only appears on the next branch now. I would suggest trying rebase your branch on next, re-compile, and run your problem again\nI just tried running with your above input, and I got something that looks okay.
