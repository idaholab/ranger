          "bodyText": "Hi MOOSE developers,\nI have questions about the paper 'Solidification and grain formation in alloys: a 2D application of the grand-potential-based phase-field approach' and I have sent an email to the author of this paper. However, I didn't get a reply, so I try to ask questions here. Any help is appreciated. The following texts are the email context.\nI am a Ph.D. student majoring in materials science and engineering and I am new to this field. Recently, I read your work published in Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering journal. The title of this paper is \u2018Solidification and grain formation in alloys: a 2D application of the grand-potential-based phase-field approach.\u2019\nI think this is an excellent starting point for my research. I want to simulate the dendrite growth under different laser heating paths. Therefore, I use the demo file in the MOOSE directory (moose/modules/phase_field/examples/anisotropic_interfaces/GrandPotentialPlanarGrowth.i) as my start and try to reproduce your work, especially figure 12, figure 13, and figure 14 in the paper.\nAfter I modify the input file, try to implement the antitrapping current and Langevin noise in the kernel. I find it hard to converge, so I change the input parameters. I am using the parameters in \u2018GrandPotentialPlanarGrowth.i\u2019 and only add antitrapping current and Langevin noise. The attachments are my input file and the final output log. Also, I have several questions related to this work.\n\nThe mu in the code (in GenericConstantMaterial) is the bulk energy coefficient, right?\nHow do you determine the \u2018-aW\u2019 in the antitrapping current term? I see this value is 0.8 in \u2018GrandPotentialAnisotropyAntitrap.i\u2019 but I do see you use different values (aW = 0.113, 0.095, 0.071) when you discuss the effect of antitrapping current in figure 10. I am not sure which value I should use.\nHow do you implement the wavy surface in figure 12? Is it possible to use 'FunctionIC' to implement this in MOOSE?\nIs there any possible ways to speed up the convergence?\n\nThank you for your time. Any help is appreciated.\nSincerely,\nGuo-Chi Li\nInput_file.log\noutput_log.log",

The paper presents a parametric study on how this affects solidification behavior. The actual values could vary with the problem setup. The paper discusses this briefly (check out Appendix C).\n\nYes. I have read that part. I need to find those references since I am unfamiliar with this part. I will check them out.\n\nYou probably meant figure 14. I used a Sine function to set it up.\n\nYes. I am discussing figure 14. I mean, I think you probably implement Sine function using something like parsed_function or FunctionIC in MOOSE. Is that right?\n\nIn general, complex alloy solidification problems can be hard to solve. You can non-dimensionalize your model parameters to improve that.\n\nThanks. I will look into this.\nIs it possible to provide the input files you used in this work? It is ok if you still need them for your future publications and can't release them now.\nSincerely,\nGuo-Chi Li",

It seems that in the update, the result of the .norm() function call has changed in some way.  So I have 2 questions:\n\nI cannot for the life of me determine how to print out the components of _velocity[_qp].  It looks like it's ultimately a templated libMesh object.  I figure if I could just inspect the object a bit, I might be able to determine what changed and fix it.\nAny ideas what may have changed with the norm function during that update?",

At 0, this operation is not differntiable.\nLikely you only need to take the norm of the Real(Vector), so do:\n_velocity[_qp].value().norm() < 1.e-8\n\nor use the normsq() function, avoiding the square root\nGuillaume",

The CAD is provided as an assembly in a STEP file; and I would like to make it into a single, continuous, high quality, tetrahedral mesh. Does anyone have any experience/recommendations for a pipeline/process to achieve this?\nSo far I have tried:\n\nUsing blender to \"boolean\" all the parts together, export to STL, and mesh in tetgen. I struggled to avoid intersecting segments/facets, and the conversion to STL discretises the geometry before meshing, often with \"ugly\" triangles.\nUsing FreeCAD to \"fuse\" parts together, export to STL, and mesh in tetgen. This comes with the same problems as above, as well as the fact FreeCAD struggles to fuse parts which aren't exactly aligned (in Blender I was doing a little manual extrusion to fix this).\n\nI haven't tried:\n\nHand coding a script to make a poly file for tetgen, as the geometry is too complex.\nUsing Cubit as discussed in this post, as it isn't free for commercial use.\nUsing Gmsh. This is likely our next port of call, especially if it is recommended here.\n\nThanks.",

I want to use a reference to the FEProblem class. **_So I wrote the statement \"_fe_problem(parameters.get<FEProblem >(\"fe_problem\"))\" in the constructor of the subclass and successfully used it to fetch something from the FEProblem class, but this statement causes my configuration file to not work properly, i.e. it compiles successfully but does not run the configuration file. I would like to know if there is any way to compile and run it successfully.",
