The procedure that I was following before was creating the necessary files that I needed and I was adding them to the \"materials\" directory in Blackbear for \"src\" and \"include\" directories. Then I was running \"make\" in Blackbear to include these new files for my simulations. I know it is not the most common way to do it but it was working fine and it was the easiest way because they were only 2 files.\nI have tried to do the same now but it seems like the functions from the added files in Blackbear are not recognise and I am receiving errors such as:\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the object \"k_func\", of type \"PiecewiseLinear\".\nA parameter was passed for an option using data from a CSV file but the 'data_file' parameter has not been set. This is not allowed\nIs it because I am not including correctly other modules? I have tried to change the Makefile and set it to include all modules, but it is not working. I am running the simulation as:\nmpirun -np 20 path/blackbear/blackbear-opt -i MaterialDeposition.i\nThank you in advance.",

          "bodyText": "Dear Moose team,\nI use \"ComputeElasticityTensor\" to simulate the elastic deformation around a circular tunnel in a transversely isotropic rock (layered rock). The geometry of the model is shown schematically below.\n\nIn this example, the isotropic plane is tilted 45 degrees about the y-axis and the rock medium has an initial isotropic stress of 30 MPa. With these assumptions, we can define the orientation of roke layers by assuming \"euler_angle_1=90\" and \"euler_angle_2=45\" (the input file is attached).\nMy first thought was that the \"euler_angle_3\" doesn't play a role here, since it only describes the rotation of the isotropic plane (around the axis of anisotropy). But I saw that changing the euler_angle_3 has a significant effect on the deformation pattern around the tunnel. Figure below shows the displacement magnitude for three different values of euler_angle_3:\n\nOnly the results for euler_angle_3=90 look reasonable! However, a small change in the ComputeElasticityTensor.C file produces exactly the results I expect.\nI changed:\nRotationTensor R(_Euler_angles); // Type R: RealTensorValue.\n// Rotate the elasticity tensor\n_Cijkl.rotate(R);\nto:\nRotateTensor R(_Euler_angles); // type R: RealTensorValue.\n// Rotate elasticity tensor\n_Cijkl.rotate(R.transpose());\nWith the above change in the rotation matrix, the elastic deformation becomes independent of euler_angle_3 for transversely isotropic materials.\n\nCould you please review the rotation matrix in the ComputeElasticityTensor.C file and let me know if such a change is needed or not? i also attached the input file (+mesh)\nBest regards,\nKavan\nTransverselyIsotropic.zip",

                  "bodyText": "Gotta be really careful here to get what you want. This has tripped me up many times. MOOSE uses a specific Euler angle convention (there are a lot) which assumes both specific axes being rotated about and the ordering. Be sure to read the documentation on this (link). It matters if you're rotating the material to a specific orientation or if you're rotating the axes. I believe the default in MOOSE is to use the latter. Your modification is likely assuming the former, which is why you want the transpose. There is an example in the documentation similar to this where the negative of the desired angle is needed, which amounts to a transposed rotation matrix (for a single rotation).\nIf I'm understanding your problem, you want to rotate about the y-axis, but MOOSE uses the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles 1, 2, and 3. It may be easier in your case to instead provide the rotation matrix (or the transpose of it) to ComputeElasticityTensor (again see the docs on how to do this). Or you could re-orient your problem so the desired rotation is about the z-axis.",

As far as I know, MOOSE uses the Z-X'-Z'' convention (this is also clear from RotationTensor.C). Actually, I wanted to adopt this approach to define the orientation of geological structures (faults, stratifications, rock layers ...) with respect to the global coordinate. In engineering geology, any plane rotated in the x-y-z coordinate is described by only two rotation angles: 1) the dip direction (rotation about Z) and 2) the dip angle (rotation about X'). In other words, the third rotation about Z'' does not change the principal material coordinate. If I understand you correctly, the Euler angle approach may not be directly applicable to these applications. I guess I will follow your suggestion and provide a rotation matrix resulting from only two rotations (Z and X').\nThank you again, Kavan",

So the results for the rotated tensor and e.g. the resulting strain will be different if you insert an e.g. matrix for an active-extrinsic rotation instead of an active-intrinsic one.\nI compared the results for the rotated tensor and resulting strain with results from python (scipy, pytransform3D + matscipy), COMSOL, and OOF2 (where I used Bunge notation). The results match if I use an intrinsic and active rotation (matrix).\nCan you confirm that using active and intrinsic definition of the rotation for matrix-input is correct?\nEDIT: I did compute passive-extrinsic Euler-angels out of my active and intrinsic rotation matrix and do get with these angles directly fed into MOOSE the same results.",

          "bodyText": "Problem\nI'm running single phase Porous Flow simulations and hoping to speed them up.\nI thought I wouldn't need relative permeability in the single phase case, as phase disappearance shouldn't be a problem, and so tried a constant relative permeability of 1. This worked fine for a small 2D test and did actually reduce the run time, but as soon as I tried it on a more complex geometry, it would only get through one or two nonlinear iterations before failing to converge (Linear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_NANORINF iterations 0 -> Nonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_LINEAR_SOLVE iterations 1).\nAs a compromise I returned to the Corey version, and bumped n down to 2 (and even 1) as suggested in the page on nonlinear convergence. This also failed to converge and only works with a minimum value of n = 3. I also (briefly) tried using FLAC, as it was faster than Corey on the simpler case, however that too failed on the more complex case.\nWhat is likely to be causing this to happen, and is there a way I can get around it?\nBackground\nI'm actually simulating a fluid being injected into a completely dry porous medium, which isn't something directly supported by the Porous Flow module. I've written a custom \"capillary pressure\" user object, which calculates saturation on a curve between $S\\approx0$ at $P=0$ and $S\\approx1$ at $P=2P_f$ (where $P_f$ is some nominal pressure at the flow front).\nThis approach is working pretty well, and I've validated it against some analytical cases, however at the mesh resolutions I require (based on convergence studies with my material properties) the run times are far too long.\nHence I'm trying to simplify any aspects of Porous Flow not applicable to my case, relative permeability appearing to be a low hanging fruit. Incidentally if there are any other suggestions for simplifications/optimisations I could make, I'd love to hear them!",

Absolute worst case I can use the slow (n = 3) version.\nI don't think I can initialise any better, as my only variable (P) is set to a global IC of 0 which is the physical reality.

I don't think it helps that I'm working in absolute pressure and so negative pressure doesn't make much sense. Regardless, using the positive pressure value to calculate saturation has worked for me so far.",

If it is not, let me know and I can take it down (or you're welcome to delete it).\nI'd really like to learn more about the nuts and bolts of the mathematical theory behind solid mechanics FEA simulations. I've really been trying hard to read about FEA and plasticity, but it doesn't seem to be \"clicking\" for me yet. I have a good intuition for what is going on in the background but I don't have a great understanding for the actual system of equations and solution sequence that are being solved.\nI have a copy of the \"Introduction to Computational Plasticity\" book that is often referenced here. It does seem like a good book that I'm able to mostly follow, but I just wish there were some more examples and problems to work through. I also have a hard time following complex mathematical proofs without good examples and problems to work through to put it together.\nTo the seasoned moose solid mechanics experts: Is there a certain reference/references, detailed example problem, or university class/classes that helped bridge the gap for you?\nI'm just rambling at this point, but I think a good book idea would be describing in extreme detail one \"cycle\" of a simple 3D solid mechanics FEA problem. It could cover in detail something like a simple 3x3x3 3D mesh with some some simple boundary conditions. It could be broken up similar to how moose presents the Plug-n-Play system (i.e., 1) Compute Strain, 2) Compute the Elasticity Tensor, 3) Compute Stress... etc). The theory could be taught, but also, we could be working towards solving the one simple example problem throughout the book.\nTLDR - I want to understand but don't currently. I'd like to know the best references that helped you see the light.",
