          "bodyText": "Looking at the source code for TemperatureDependentHardeningStressUpdate, it seems that if you have hardening functions at temperatures of 100, 200, 300, 400, and a node is at a temperature of 500, the lines:\n  else if (temp <= _hf_temperatures[0])\n  {\n    _hf_index_lo = 0;\n    _hf_index_hi = _hf_index_lo;\n    _hf_fraction = 0.0;\n  }\n  else if (temp >= _hf_temperatures.back())\n  {\n    _hf_index_lo = _hf_temperatures.size() - 1;\n    _hf_index_hi = _hf_index_lo;\n    _hf_fraction = 1.0;\n  }\n\nindicate that the node will use the hardening function defined for 400 k. However, when I run two models, one with functions at 100, 200, 300, 400, and one with functions at 100, 200, 300, 400, 600 but the 600 function is the same stress-strain function as the one defined at 400, the results are very different. This to me indicates something is going wrong with the handling of these out of range temperature values?",

Erroring is not always the best option, these values could be visited only temporarily during the nonlinear solve.\nExtrapolations eventually dont make sense either.\nIt's up to modeler to make sure their result is within bounds.\nWhat we should do is document this behavior though. Where is the documentation for that object?\nGuillaume",

This is working sucessfully, and is leading to .cpa and .xda files instead of the normal .cpr and .xdr files. Setting file = xxxx.cpa in mesh is working and the restart is loading the mesh in, however I can't find info on how to tell the problem to search for restart files in the .xda format instead of .xdr, which leads to lots of \"unable to find file xxx.xdr\" errors when I run. I've tried setting binary = false in problem to mirror the argument given to the checkpoint output, but that doesn't seem to help. Any advice would be appreciated.",

So I copied this one AdvectionBC.h & AdvectionBC.C and changed the register code in AdvectionBC.C file:\nregisterMooseObject(\"MyselfAPP\", AdvectionBC);\nThis is the only line I changed to the source code. I put the .h file in the include file and .c file in the src file. I could compile the app but when I am trying to running the input file, it gave me a message that A 'AdvectionBC' is not a registered object..\nI am kind of confused since I thought I had registered this object. Is there any other reason that make the registration of object fail?\nThank you so much for any kind of help.",
