          "bodyText": "The Idaho National Laboratory is providing a MOOSE and a BISON training in January 2025 at University of Massachusetts in Lowell.\nFor the MOOSE workshop on January 15-16:\nMOOSE is an open-source finite element & finite volume framework developed by the DOE national laboratories that is the base for much of the advanced nuclear reactor modeling software. There are also several ongoing projects to develop MOOSE applications for fusion device modeling.\nThe Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) Workshop provides an in-depth introduction to the framework. The course is two days in length and covers material starting from the mathematical underpinnings of the framework through advanced features of the MOOSE Multiapps system. The course uses a realistic multiphysics problem that is solved with increasing realism and complexity utilizing the many pluggable systems in the framework. Hands on exercises are supplied so attendees are encouraged to bring their own hardware to participate. More information about MOOSE can be found on our website.\n\n\nFlow simulations of a spent fuel cask and a T-junction using MOOSE\n\nFor BISON workshop on January 17th:\nThe BISON fuel performance team is hosting a one-day, workshop. This workshop is intended to help prospective users get started with the code, provide an overview of the methods to model specific fuel types, and provide practical examples to help users gain experience. Please forward this message to anyone at your institution interested in BISON, fuel performance modeling, or MOOSE-related software.\nWORKSHOP TOPICS\n\u2022 Introduction to thermomechanical fuel performance modeling and multiphysics analysis\n\u2022 Code development principles and contribution of new models\n\u2022 Overview of LWR, TRISO, and Metallic fuel capabilities\n\u2022 Meshing fuel geometries\n\u2022 Simulation output analysis and visualization\nThe registration deadline will be flexible for the MOOSE training but we encourage early registration as space is limited. Registration for the BISON workshop will close January 15th. Access to a BISON license by the training date is not guaranteed. Please email me for any issue or question with registration.\nRegistration link: https://ncrcaims.inl.gov/Identity/Account/TrainingRegistration",
