However, when utilizing PJFNK, this issue does not occur.\nAdditionally, when using the Eigenvalue executioner, even in serial mode with the JFNK solver, the following error arises:\n -------------------------------\n Free power iteration starts ...\n -------------------------------\n\n[0]PETSC ERROR: --------------------- Error Message --------------------------------------------------------------\n[0]PETSC ERROR: Unknown type.

The meshes used in testing were generated using MOOSE commands, but custom materials, kernels, and boundary conditions were applied during testing. However, these custom classes only involve simple overloading of functions related to Qp calculations. I haven't made any modifications regarding parallelism or preconditioners, so I'm at a loss regarding the occurrence of these two issues. Does anyone know how to address these problems? I've attempted to pinpoint which part of the code is causing the errors but have been unsuccessful. Can anyone provide guidance on how to locate the erroneous code?\nThank you for your assistance.\nSincerely,\nhityyds",

I'm curious to understand the optimizations or enhancements made within MOOSE that contribute to this speedup in mesh partitioning. Are these optimizations something that can be leveraged solely within LibMesh?\nMy current problem-solving cycle is quite complex and challenging to implement directly within the MOOSE framework; otherwise, I would be inclined to utilize MOOSE for my simulations. I'm specifically interested in whether there are ways to achieve similar partitioning speed improvements by tweaking settings or using certain features in LibMesh directly. Currently, I'm using the default Metis partitioner provided by LibMesh.\nAny insights or suggestions on how to optimize mesh partitioning speed within LibMesh or details about the enhancements made in MOOSE would be greatly appreciated.",

I should mention that when I updated Conda and MOOSE earlier today, I had the same 'Build and Test Errors' described here (link: #26876), and I could only solve them using conda update --all after updating MOOSE which I thought was odd?\nShould I remove my local moose and projects repositories and follow the installation steps from scratch again?",

          "bodyText": "Hi, I would like to understand how to use this object to fully describe plastic deformation. As I understand plasticity theory, three things are needed to fully describe the system:\n-Yield Function, i.e the function (typically stress-based i.e a function of the stress components) that calculates the yield surface, that is, where the material should begins to yield\n-Flow Rule, i.e the function that explains how the material evolves beyond the yield surface\n-Hardening Law: does the material harden isotropically (does the yield surface expand while staying centered about the origin?) or kinematically (does it remain constant in size but move with the changing yield stress?).\nAccording to IsotropicPlasticityStressUpdate, it implements the radial return algorithm for a Von Mises yield function, but can be used in conjunction with more complex ones (and hopefully, custom yield functions). Looking at one of the example files, we have:\n[Materials]\n  [./elasticity_tensor]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = 2.1e5\n    poissons_ratio = 0.3\n  [../]\n  [./isotropic_plasticity]\n    type = IsotropicPlasticityStressUpdate\n    yield_stress = 50.0\n    hardening_function = hf\n  [../]\n  [./radial_return_stress]\n    type = ComputeMultipleInelasticStress\n    tangent_operator = elastic\n    inelastic_models = 'isotropic_plasticity'\n  [../]\n[]\n\nI see that the elasticity tensor is defined, a single value for the yield stress is defined, and a hardening function \"hf\" is also defined.\nQ1: Where would I define my custom yield function to be compared with the yield stress? As mentioned before, the default is the Von Mises stress. If I create a material file to calculate the custom yield surface based on the components of the elastic stress (which is initially calculated before doing a radial return), how do I let the model know to use that instead of the default Von Mises Stress?\nQ1b: What if the yield function cannot be easily expressed in the form sigma_yield - f(sigma_ii) = 0? And instead is \"implicit\" i.e defined as f(sigma_yield, sigma_ii) = 0? For example, the Hoek-Brown Yield Criterion. Would that mean I can't use this object?\nQ2: how do I \"extract\" which stress I want to use? If the model only used ComputeLinearElasticStress, then in a custom material file, I would \"get\" this stress with\n_stress(getADMaterialPropertyByName<RankTwoTensor>(\"stress\")),\nIn this case where I have multiple stresses being calculated, what are the names of the stresses? For example, if I have both plasticity and viscoelasticity, what is the name of the \"overall\" stress (i.e the true stress experienced by the material) that I need to \"get\"? What about the name of the elastic stress? (So I can use it to check if the material is yielding).\nQ3: How does the model know which elastic stress to use (finite or small strain)? In the ComputeMultipleInelasticStress, I see tangent_operator = elastic. Is the computation based on the strain defined? If I used, say, ADComputeGreenLagrangeStrain, would it automatically compute the PK2 stress?\nQ4: Where do I define the flow rule? My guess is that the line hardening_function = hf is supposed to, but how? For an associative flow rule, it would be the derivative of the yield function with respect to stress. Where is that computed? What if I wanted to implement a custom, non-associative flow rule?\nQ5: Where do I define the hardening law? That is, whether or not the yield function moves or expands in both compressive & tensile directions simultaneously?",
