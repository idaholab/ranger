At this step it starts not converging until the step size is reduced to unacceptable and the programme terminates automatically.\nOne of the tensor mechanics is solved in explicit dynamics, so there is no convergence problem.

They are very close to each other, both are moments when the catastrophic collapse is about to start.

But at least looking at the final output, I can't see a big distortion, before and after turning off transfer as shown below.\n\n\nI will use restart and output to the exodus file step by step starting from the approaching error instead of '''interval'''.\nAlso, I'll check the\nsrc/fe/fe_map.C: libmesh_catch (ConvergenceFailure &)\nsrc/geom/cell_tet4.C: libmesh_catch (ConvergenceFailure &)",

So first compare them both with rdg_slope_reconstruction = none. The differences in the results are quite striking though, so I'd be surprised if that were everything.\nI think the main reason may be the volume you've chosen does not yield an equivalent problem. You have A = 1 and volume = 1, so it's like you're junction is actually L = volume / A = 1 long, twice the length of each of the pipes. For an equivalent problem, probably choose the volume to give you an element length. Then take away one element from one of the connected pipes. Then you probably need to shift the ICs by a half element. Make sense? You basically want to replace one of the elements from the one-to-one junction case with this volume junction.",

          "bodyText": "Hello MOOSE users,\nI am trying to modify the input script that performs a frequency-domain analysis of a cantilever to have it accept several materials. The source example is here:\nmodules/solid_mechanics/examples/wave_propagation/cantilever_sweep.i\nI am reading a mesh from an exodus file where blocks were already pre-defined (blocks 1, 2, ... N). I would like to assign material properties based on the block definitions. The elastic properties is easy and having N snippets like this one works:\n  [elastic_tensor_Al]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = 68e9\n    poissons_ratio = 0.36\n    block = 1\n  []\n\nBut I still haven't found a way to define densities based on block definitions. Density is provided in:\n[Functions]\n  [./freq2]\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    symbol_names = density\n    symbol_values = 2.7e3 #Al kg/m3\n    expression = '-t * t * density'\n  [../]\n[]\n\nParsedFunction does not accept a 'block' argument. I tried using variations of if-else statements, like \" expression = if(block==1,'freq1' ,if(block==2, 'freq2', 'freq3')) \". I tried for expression and symbol_names/symbol_values but unsuccessfully.\nAny ideas?\nMany thanks.\nLuca",

So copying from the original example in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/solid_mechanics/1d_elastic_waves.html :\n[Functions]\n  [./freq2]\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    symbol_names = density\n    symbol_values = 2.7e3 #Al kg/m3\n    expression = '-t * t * density'\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Controls]\n  [./func_control]\n    type = RealFunctionControl\n    parameter = 'Kernels/*/rate'\n    function = 'freq2'\n    execute_on = 'initial timestep_begin'\n  [../]\n[]\n\nFrom here I understand that freq2 is of type FunctionName and density is the name (string) of a variable to which value 2700 is assigned inside the definition of freq2. t is time. This input file was among the examples provided in the solid_mechanics/examples folder. All I need to do is to specify -- based on blocks defined in the ingested mesh -- two different densities. So, if you like, it would be finding the resonances of a bilayered beam of say aluminium (say block = 1) and steel (say block = 2).\nSince RealFunctionControl takes a function as parameter I cannot specify a ParsedMaterial instead of ParsedFunction, unless there's a workaround (?)\nThanks!\nLuca",
