The updating of the variable is very simple and i am trying to avoid coupling nonlinear variables as the problem is complex as it is. So i think that using an AuxKernel is the way to go.\nHowever, I am not sure how the nodal variables are accessed in AuxKernels, since _u_old is evaluated at _qp, and I am aware also that there is a _nodal flag for AuxKernels but I still do not know how it is indexed for each node and didn't find examples for it. As far as I have seen in the code is that isNodal() function determines whether _qp=0 but it is not clear how to index different nodes. Also, are the initial conditions for AuxVariables are set to zero by default?\nThis is not a boundary variable, so would you recommend using AuxKernel or Material for this?\nThank you,\nKhaled",

The changes should not affect your simulation except that you might see performance gains for large-scale parallel runs. If you run into trouble with the updated PETSc, please let us know.\nTo access the updated PETSc, conda users could do a conda update (\"conda update --all\"). For source code users, you could rerun PETSc and libMesh update scripts (./scripts/update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh and ./scripts/update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh). Just like any other dependency updates, you might run \"make clobberall\" to remove old links before you rebuild MOOSE.\nIf you have any questions, please let us know.\nThanks for your support, as always.\nThe MOOSE Team",
