          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nI have a question about using SpecifiedSmoothCircleIC to set the initial condition of circle. I want to generate a initial condition like this,\n\nIn the most part of the square model, the initial c is set as 0, however, in some small circles, the initial condition should be set as larger values. How can I randomly generate some values for the circle's initial concentration in some range? I saw that in all the examples shown in SpecifiedSmoothCircleIC webpage, the initial concentration can only be set as one specific value. How can I set different values for each circle's concentration? Or I can only set the same value for the two circles?\n\nThank you,\nBest,",

Finally, user CoupledValueFunctionIC for main variable and multiply two temp variables. I hope that it may work.",

It's got a bit of test coverage in libMesh that does double duty as usage examples: miscellaneous examples 1, 14, and 15 ... but has it ever been used in MOOSE?  It's a non-default configuration option and I don't think it's one that the default MOOSE libMesh build script has enabled ... and although MOOSE users can work with a custom-configured libMesh, git grep InfElemBuilder isn't showing me anything in MOOSE, and I think a meshgenerator calling on that would have been the very first thing a user would have added.  It wouldn't have been the last thing, though; the Sobolev-weighted quadrature needed for element assembly is slightly different too.",
