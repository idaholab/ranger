However, I also want to output an elemental variable for each node.\nMy elemental variable must stay elemental as it is part of the discrete nucleation kernel and has to be an elemental auxiliary variable. Is there a way to get nucl_map to output with the vectorpostprocessors? Like an average of the elemental values per node? I looked at the DiscreteNucleatoinData post-processor. I provided some code below. Thank you so much for your help!

By computing the velocities and the accelerations using NewmarkVelAux and NewmarkAccelAux, it always uses the previous displacements, velocities and accelerations and the new displacements to compute the new velocities and accelerations. Importantly, the new displacements are computed independently. Hence, the information about the initial velocities, that I supplied, never enters the computation of the displacements. The computation of the velocities and displacements is purely driven by the computation of the displacements. There is no coupling between them.",

          "bodyText": "Dear Moose Forum Members,\nI hope this message finds you well. I am currently seeking assistance regarding the automatic termination of simulations when the runtime exceeds a specified threshold.\nI have been utilizing PerfGraphData to acquire runtime information and subsequently employing Terminator to set termination conditions in my input file, as demonstrated below:\n[UserObjects]\n  [./term]\n    type = Terminator\n    expression = 'run_time > 600'\n  [../]\n[]\n[Postprocessors]\n...\n  [./run_time]\n    type = PerfGraphData\n    section_name = \"Root\"\n    data_type = total\n  [../]\n...\n[./]\nHowever, I have encountered an issue where Terminator and PerfGraphData only execute at the beginning or end of a timestep, rather than terminating the simulation once the overall runtime exceeds a certain threshold. Therefore, my inquiry is whether there exists a method or condition to automatically terminate the simulation when it reaches a specified runtime threshold, such as after 10 minutes of computation.\nThe reason behind my quest for this functionality is that in the simulations I have created, the output continuously displays \"Computing Residual,\" as illustrated below:\nTime Step 8, time = 0.108816, dt = 0.020736\n\nGrain Tracker Status:\nGrains active index 0: 1 -> 1\nGrains active index 1: 1 -> 1\n\nFinished inside of GrainTracker\n\n    Computing Residual............................................................................................................................................\n\nHowever, attempts to terminate the program using ctrl + c or killall have been unsuccessful in generating *.prof files. On the contrary, the automatic termination of the simulation has successfully generated *.prof files.\nI would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to achieve automated termination based on a runtime threshold.\nThank you for your time and assistance.\nBest regards,\nWei",

What might be the reason for this?\nOr if there's other way to set this kind of symmetric boundary condition?\nThanks!
