In my code, I have three vectors of materials, and their sizes remain constant throughout the iterations. I have been exploring options to manipulate the values of these vectors using Vectorpostprocessor (VPP) or reporters, or any other alternative method available. However, it seems that the existing VPPs and reporters are designed for real values and not specifically for vector materials.\nI have attempted to adapt SamplerBase VPPs, such as LineMaterialRealSampler and LineValueSampler, and I have also tried creating a new code based on the existing base by utilizing references, objects, and pointers to access the vector values on the material-based code. Unfortunately, I have encountered errors throughout these attempts.\nNow, I am seeking suggestions or assistance on how to effectively manipulate the values of these vectors.

(For example, j = 50 corresponds to the number density of the precipitate phi3 phase with a specific size of 5 nm, stored in Rho_out_Vector[phi3][j], \u00a0or j = 500 represents the number density of precipitates with other sizes, such as 93 nm.) These vectors are obtained for tracking the evolution of number densities for different sizes of precipitates over time in a transient simulation.\nRegarding the use of the multiapp, if there is a pre-existing transfer code designed for transferring these vectors within the simulation, it would be suitable for my needs (specifically for the next steps of my project).\nSince you mentioned that only vectors can be used, I employed other material properties calculated in the input file to compute these vectors, but these vectors of material properties are utilized to return results to the input file; there are no other computations involved in this simulation.\nThank you once again for your assistance.\nSajjad",

These oscillations are always concentrated near the transition zones for mesh refinement.\n\nI have tried this with several iterations on the problem setup (finite strain, no vol lock correction, total formulation) but I see the same stress oscillations each time. Also, I see no oscillations with a purely elastic material.\nAny insight into this issue would be much appreciated.",

The subdomains on the 'refine' mesh are being discarded by CombinerGenerator. It seems that which ever mesh is listed first in 'inputs' has its subdomain IDs preserved. I need the subdomain IDs on both meshes to be preserved. Is there a workaround for this?\nedit: Note that all of the subdomainIDs between both meshes are unique",
