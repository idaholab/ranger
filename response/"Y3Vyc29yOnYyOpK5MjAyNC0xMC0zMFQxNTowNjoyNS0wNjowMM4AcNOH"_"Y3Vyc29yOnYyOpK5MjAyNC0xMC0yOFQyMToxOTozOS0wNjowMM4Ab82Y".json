          "bodyText": "Hello,\nIn the \"Small Strain\" framework, we typically restart jobs by utilizing the [UserObjects] block or by prescribing initial conditions (IC) on the desired variables. However, this approach has not been feasible in the \"Finite Strain\" framework, and we are unclear why it's impossible to apply an IC condition in this context.\nTo address this, we have switched to using checkpoints for restarting jobs. This method, however, results in the creation of numerous large subfolders  and several gigabytes of data. Additionally, a limitation we've encountered is the inability to change the number of processors (procs) between the initial job and the restart\u2014running the first job with X procs means we must use the same number for subsequent jobs.\nWe have reviewed the \"Restart and Recover\" documentation but have not found an effective solution to these issues. Could you please provide guidance on how to reduce the volume of generated data and advise on a strategy to run jobs with varying numbers of procs?\nThank you for your assistance.",

At the left boundary, I apply a displacement boundary condition that ramps up to a fixed displacement value, holding it constant afterward.\nWhile the displacement profile appears correct, I am observing significant fluctuations in the velocity at the left boundary. I expected these velocities to remain relatively small due to the fixed displacement condition following the ramp-up phase. Could these fluctuations be attributed to numerical artifacts, or are there other potential causes for this behavior?\nThank you for any insights.\nanimation of disp_x and vel_x:\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n    disp_vel.mp4\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nmy input file:\nrho = 1e-6\nhht_alpha = -0.00\nbeta = '${fparse (1-hht_alpha)^2/4}'\ngamma = '${fparse 1/2-hht_alpha}'\n\n[Mesh]\n  [fmg]\n    type = FileMeshGenerator\n    file = './mesh/bar.msh'\n  []\n[]\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n  alpha = ${hht_alpha}\n  beta = ${beta}\n  gamma = ${gamma}\n  large_kinematics = true\n  use_displaced_mesh = false\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [disp_x]\n  []\n  [disp_y]\n  []\n  [disp_z]\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxVariables] \n  [accel_x]\n  []\n  [vel_x]\n  []\n  [accel_y]\n  []\n  [vel_y]\n  []\n  [accel_z]\n  []\n  [vel_z]\n  []\n  [stress_xx]\n    order = CONSTANT\n    family = MONOMIAL\n    [AuxKernel]\n      type = RankTwoAux\n      rank_two_tensor = cauchy_stress\n      index_i = 0\n      index_j = 0\n      execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_END'\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [solid_x]\n    type = TotalLagrangianStressDivergence\n    variable = disp_x\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n    component = 0\n  []\n  [inertia_x] # M*accel + eta*M*vel\n    type = ADInertialForce\n    variable = disp_x\n    velocity = vel_x\n    acceleration = accel_x\n    density = density\n  []\n  [solid_y]\n    type = TotalLagrangianStressDivergence\n    variable = disp_y\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n    component = 1\n  []\n  [inertia_y] # M*accel + eta*M*vel\n    type = ADInertialForce\n    variable = disp_y\n    velocity = vel_y\n    acceleration = accel_y\n    density = density\n  []\n  [solid_z]\n    type = TotalLagrangianStressDivergence\n    variable = disp_z\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n    component = 2\n  []\n  [inertia_z] # M*accel + eta*M*vel\n    type = ADInertialForce\n    variable = disp_z\n    velocity = vel_z\n    acceleration = accel_z\n    density = density\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxKernels]\n  [accel_x] # Calculates and stores acceleration at the end of time step\n    type = NewmarkAccelAux\n    variable = accel_x\n    displacement = disp_x\n    velocity = vel_x\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n  [vel_x] # Calculates and stores velocity at the end of the time step\n    type = NewmarkVelAux\n    variable = vel_x\n    acceleration = accel_x\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n  [accel_y] # Calculates and stores acceleration at the end of time step\n    type = NewmarkAccelAux\n    variable = accel_y\n    displacement = disp_y\n    velocity = vel_y\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n  [vel_y] # Calculates and stores velocity at the end of the time step\n    type = NewmarkVelAux\n    variable = vel_y\n    acceleration = accel_y\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n  [accel_z] # Calculates and stores acceleration at the end of time step\n    type = NewmarkAccelAux\n    variable = accel_z\n    displacement = disp_z\n    velocity = vel_z\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n  [vel_z] # Calculates and stores velocity at the end of the time step\n    type = NewmarkVelAux\n    variable = vel_z\n    acceleration = accel_z\n    execute_on = timestep_end\n  []\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n  [load]\n    type = ADParsedFunction\n    expression = '0.4*(1-exp(-2.3983e5*t))'\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [left_x]\n    type = ADFunctionDirichletBC\n    boundary = '1'\n    variable = disp_x\n    function = load\n    preset = true\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [bulk]\n    type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'density'\n    prop_values = '${rho}'\n  []\n  [elasticity]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = 30000\n    poissons_ratio = 0.2\n  []\n  [stress]\n    type = ComputeLagrangianLinearElasticStress\n    # outputs = 'vtk'\n  []\n  [strain]\n    type = ComputeLagrangianStrain \n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = NEWTON\n  start_time = 0\n  end_time = 3e-4\n  dt = 1e-6\n  dtmin = 5e-9\n  nl_rel_tol = 1e-6\n  nl_abs_tol = 1e-8\n  l_tol = 1e-6\n  # r_tol = 1e-6\n  # nl_max_its = 20\n  nl_max_its = 500\n  l_max_its = 500\n  line_search = None\n  [TimeIntegrator]\n    type = NewmarkBeta\n    inactive_tsteps = 1\n  []\n  []\n[]",

On the webpage https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Modules/TensorMechanics/Master/index.html, it is mentioned that it generates aux variables and auxkernels to aid in the output of tensor components. So I think those stress components I added in generate_output = 'stress_xx strain_xx' are not material properties, but a kind of AuxVariables and AuxKernels calculated based on the solid mechanics equations, which should follow the restarting methods of AuxVariables. If I use Checkpoint restart, will all these outputs be automatically inherited into new simulations from the checkpoint file?\nIf so, is strain_xx inheritable? Because I have chosen in Variables to let the displacement inherit the previous simulation, so the strain should be recalculated based on the displacement field at the beginning of the second simulation?\nI'm a bit confused about this, before the Tensor Mechanics Master Action setting came out, I thought my strategy would be to create AuxVaribales and AuxKernels for each stress component and use initial_from_file_var, but not do this for strain_xx since the displacement field is already inherited  .  Now after using Master/all I am a little confused about this.\nI hope you can clear it up for me, thank you very much!\nBest regards,\nDaijun",

In fact we can see the correct displacement at the first increment while the strain and stress computations are wrong. This in echelon test works fine in small strain even when coupled with phase field fracture. I wonder if it's because of the strain initialization at the ComputeFiniteStrain ? Thanks for any help.",
