This also restores full compatibility with macOS 12.3. On Linux, this change results in an update to GCC 10.3.0. Alongside this change, moose-petsc and the PETSc submodule was updated to 3.16.5, and moose-libmesh and the libMesh submodule was also updated.\nPlease see more detailed information in the March 2022 Newsletter regarding the package versions and builds you will see when updating, as well as a summary of changes in PETSc and libMesh. In your conda moose environment please use the command:\nmamba update --all\n\nAs the conda command equivalent might have trouble with the package dependency resolution due to the moose-mpich changes. If an update is still not achieved, please create a new moose conda environment using our Getting Started instructions.\nIf using the PETSc/libMesh submodules, please run the update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh and update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh scripts. If any issues are experienced with these updates, please open a new Discussion post. Thanks all!",

I compiled my files in debug mode and ran it in GDB. The output is attached in the pdf debug_17032022_17:04.pdf.

Also, I couldn't find where to put set_mf_reuse_base = false in my input file.

However, I am applying uniaxial compression along z-axis on a dual phase grain structure with phase-2 situated at phase-1 grain boundaries. The initial and final structures (when the simulation fails) are attached. If the phases are coming in contact after some amount of deformation, it makes sense to me that the simulation fails. I will try snesmf_reuse_base = false and check. I'll also simulate the same problem for uniaxial tension and see whether I see the same error. Many thanks for your suggestions.\nRitam",

          "bodyText": "Hi,\nI am trying to simulate a Darcy-Cahn-Hilliard model in a Hele-Shaw setting, following the equations (10) and (11) from this paper. I have implemented them without using the Porous Flow module as I was thinking that adding the coupling with Cahn-Hilliard might not be straightforward (I'll share my input file if that helps). In particular, coupling the initial Buckley\u2013Leverett problem with Cahn-Hilliard provides sufficient regularization, to some extent, to avoid resorting to artificial numerical diffusion or viscosity, while keeping a fairly sharp saturation front.\nIn addition, I have poromechanics coupling. In all, I am solving for the saturation, the pressure, the Cahn-Hilliard potential (usual splitting into two second-order PDEs) and the displacement. Note that there is only one pressure as I neglect capillary effects (Buckley\u2013Leverett setting). The porosity is coupled with the volumetric strain and pressure, as per usual poromechanics.\nI am interested in simulating the invasion of water into oil for instance. Notably, I have a Neumann BC in pressure at entry to have constant flow rate, and a Dirichlet BC in pressure at exit equal to 0; I want the fluids to be freely expelled out of the domain. However, for certain sets of parameters (e.g. low Young's modulus), the exit boundary can be highly deformed leading to convergence issues; this happens at first timestep and then the boundary relaxes back to a vertical position (see picture below at first timestep). In the setting below, saturation phase-field is shown, injection is on the left boundary, displacement is fixed to 0 everywhere but on exit right boundary (if I fix displacement on exit boundary as well, the mesh will then be distorted).\n\nI understand that this problem should be addressed by PorousFlowOutflowBC, to avoid the exit boundary to try and expel fluid that is not there yet, which I think leads to the deformation due to the poromechanics coupling. However, given the architecture of Porous Flow module, I can't really use it outside as such. I thus find myself at a crossroads between:\n\ntrying to implement this type of BC outside of the Porous Flow module architecture (how easy would that be?) and\nimplementing my model in the Porous Flow module, which benefits from all the hard work put here to address all that kind of tricky issues related to poromechanics, but might be tedious to implement my equations; in particular, adding the Cahn-Hilliard coupling and modify the existing porous flow equations accordingly. In addition, I will add in the near future further customization regarding the mechanics, which is not in Porous Flow module.\n\nThanks in advance,\nAlex",

If so, i suggest that you write your own version of the BC.  One of the benefits of MOOSE is that it is fairly easy to customize to your own physics, and i suspect your case is a situation where that is optimal.  One advantage here is that you can somewhat copy the code of PorousFlowOutflowBC.  You'll be able to omit a lot of that code because you probably don't have multicomponent fluids, and might not need upwinding.\nOne nice thing about PorousFlow is that it plays nicely with tensor_mechanics or geochemistry, which are the most common use-cases of inter-module coupling, but, you're right, it is not designed to couple naturally with all parts of MOOSE",

So I can see what issues/solutions I should be aware of. To put it briefly, I'm concerned with injecting water into oil in the \"beam\" domain above (ultimately in a Hele-Shaw cell), with constant flow rate (so Neumann BC in pressure at entry boundary). The oil pushed by water is free to flow out at the exit boundary. In addition, I want to capture the deformation due to pore pressure. Tentatively, I might be able to insert the Cahn-Hilliard bits into such example to benefit from the Porous Flow module framework.\nFirst of, I will check in more details the Convergence criteria page, which seems important in such hydromechanical coupling.\nI will be happy to share in more details once I make sure I don't have any too obvious mistakes. It is indeed a very interesting topic!",
