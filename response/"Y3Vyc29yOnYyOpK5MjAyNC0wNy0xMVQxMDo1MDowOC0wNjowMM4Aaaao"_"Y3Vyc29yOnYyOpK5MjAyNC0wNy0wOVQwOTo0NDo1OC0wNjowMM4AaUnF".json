          "bodyText": "I want to know, what features that MOOSE does't support while I am using smeared cracking (continuum damage mode) coupled with flow in porous media to simulate hydraulic fracturing propagation and then productions (flow in to the location of damage factor = 1).\nI think I need to change the permeability at the grids with damage factor = 1, after this, I need to run another flow in porous media, or it can they be coupled? In-stitu stress needs to be considered.\nCan you also see some convergence issue for coupling these two methods?",

But the convergence is poor when i did it.\nSince it's just warning the simulation can continue, should I necessarily add temperature = temp? And what's this setting about, would it make a big difference to the result?",

So it meets the requirements.\nFinally, I did manage to get a complete build of MOOSE that works!\nTo make it work, I installed CUDA 12.5, HDF5 1.14.4, UCX 1.16.0,  and  OpenMPI 5.0.3 first. Then, downloaded MOOSE and changed the PETSc vesion. When the script update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh gets PETSc from github, it downloads version 3.20. I replaced it with version 3.21.1 and commented the lines from the script to avoid it beening replaced again. Afted that I did not get another errors in the build proccess.\nI set the scrip configure_petsc.sh to run with these options:\npython3 ./configure --with-64-bit-indices \n--with-cxx-dialect=C++17 \n--with-debugging=no \n--with-fortran-bindings=0 \n--with-mpi=1 \n--with-openmp=1 \n--with-cuda=1 --with-cuda-dialect=cxx17 -CUDAOPTFLAGS=\"\" -Wno-deprecated-gpu-targets --download-kokkos --download-kokkos-kernels\n--with-shared-libraries=1 \n--with-sowing=0 \n--download-fblaslapack=1 \n--download-hypre=1 \n--download-metis=1 \n--download-mumps=1 \n--download-ptscotch=1 \n--download-parmetis=1 \n--download-scalapack=1 \n--download-strumpack=1 --download-slate\n--download-slepc=1 \n--download-superlu_dist=1 \n$HDF5_STR \n$MUMPS_ARM_STR \n$MAKE_NP_STR \n\"$@\"\nAfter that, I continued with the steps explained in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/hpc_install_moose.html#!\nThe run_tests execution gives several error, but it seems to be due to the lack of definition of -vec_type -mat_type in the tests definitions.
