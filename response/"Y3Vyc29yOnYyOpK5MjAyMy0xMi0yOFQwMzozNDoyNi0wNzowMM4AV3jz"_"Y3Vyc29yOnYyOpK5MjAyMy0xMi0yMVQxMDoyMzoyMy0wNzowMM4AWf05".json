          "bodyText": "I'm curious about how MOOSE assembles the nonlinear systems it needs to solve. If I provide two completely unrelated problems in the same inputdeck.i, will MOOSE combine the nonlinear equations of these two problems into one large system of equations and then call Petsc to solve it, or will it independently call Petsc to solve each problem?\nIn the case of two coupled problems, if I use auxvariables to decouple them (updating auxvariables with the values from the previous iteration after each linear iteration and then using auxvariables to replace the coupled variables in the next iteration), will MOOSE still combine the two problems into one large nonlinear system?\nIn fact, I have already attempted to use auxvariables to completely decouple the equations between different variables. I thought this would significantly reduce the memory usage of MOOSE because, after decoupling, the problem to be solved would shift from one extensive system of equations to multiple smaller systems. I believed this would greatly reduce the dimension of the coefficient matrix that needs to be stored. However, the test results revealed that after decoupling, MOOSE's memory usage remained almost unchanged, but the computation time decreased by nearly half.\nIf different problems are combined into one set, why does MOOSE have multiple nl_sys? My understanding is that one nonlinear system corresponds to one set of nonlinear equations.\ninline void\nFEProblemBase::setCurrentNonlinearSystem(const unsigned int nl_sys_num)\n{\n  mooseAssert(nl_sys_num < _nl.size(),\n              \"System number greater than the number of nonlinear systems\");\n  _current_nl_sys = _nl[nl_sys_num].get();\n}",

This is a current, ongoing, development. We have a separate solve between two systems in an Executioner test object that's it.\nYour understanding is correct. Different systems are solved separately.\nHowever what you did with auxiliary variables provided some degree of separation between the solves, but not to the extent of \"different matrices\" or \"solved separately\". There was still some coupling every time the auxkernel was run and it updated the variable.\nGuillaume",

I am seeking technical guidance on how to set up the material parameters and crystal plasticity model for phase 1 and phase 2 respectively, when CPFEM uses the initial microstructure from EBSD within the MOOSE framework.\nPrimarily, I have two questions:\n\nIs it possible to use EBSD data as the initial microstructure for CPFEM simulations in MOOSE?\nHow can I set different material parameters and Crystal Plasticity (CP) models for phase 1 and phase 2 after utilizing EBSD as the initial microstructure?\n\nIf there exists a well-established technical solution to accomplish these objectives, I would greatly appreciate guidance on the specific steps to follow. However, if such a solution is not readily available, I am interested in exploring the creation of a custom C++ class to achieve this purpose.\nMy aim is to effectively incorporate EBSD-derived microstructures into CPFEM simulations and establish distinct material parameters and CP models for different phases within the simulation.\nAny insights, suggestions, or guidance on established methods or custom class creation within the MOOSE framework would be immensely helpful in addressing these challenges.\nThank you in advance for your time and expertise.\nBest regards,\nWei Peng",

The rule for MOOSE to store the information along the interface is within the elements which are connected to the interface, on the side of smaller subdomain IDs. Since I need to extract the information and do post-processing, I wonder what is the best way to extract the values from exodus file.\nFor example, in one of my simulation results using TRIA3, the tangent jump is stored in the TRIA elements:\n\nHow should I extract the values for this interface, I didn't find any group information provided by MOOSE or in paraview, what I currently do is to use netCDF4 to extract element values (but I would need to get the element ID myself) which is tricky sometime.\nAny suggestion would be appreciated, thanks!",
