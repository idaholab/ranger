The way I am thinking of is that, given the coordinate of the centroid of each element (x,y,z), and the value of the material at this point, each QP in this element will copy that value.\nI have tried to use the PiecewiseMulticonstant to achieve this, but obviously, it does some interpolation that I do not want.\nFor example, in the following picture, this is the output of a simple domain with 2-elements (in 2D). I wanted to assign a value of 1 for the first element, and 2 for the second element. But the results show that element one has a value of 1 and element 2 has a value of 1.5.\n\nThe part of the input file associated with this output is as below:\n\n[Mesh]\ntype = GeneratedMesh\ndim = 2\nxmin = 0\nxmax = 1\nymin = 0\nymax = 1.0\nnx = 2\nny = 1\n[]\n\n\n[material_distribution_function]\ntype = PiecewiseMulticonstant\ndata_file = material_distribution.data\ndirection = 'left right'\n[]\n\nwhere the data_file is as follows:\n\nAXIS X\n0.25 0.75\nAXIS Y\n0.5\nDATA\n1.00\n2.00\n\nAny hint regarding this?",

In that case, specifying the direction for each axis will no longer be needed. And I believe it will be useful for non-structured mesh as well.\n@cpgr @GiudGiud Do you think we can work around this and add an option to make PiecewiseMulticonstant work without the need to specify the direction (given the centroid)",

ThePorousFlow module has explicit jacobian and I used it before. Now, I am considering to implement double porosity coupled with plasticity in Moose. But the jacobian is expected to be complex. So, I consider to use AD to compute the jacobian automatically and accurately. I try to use AD to solve the equations above since I want to use it as my starting point for some really complex equations and test if AD could be used for porous flow problem.",

The values of L are a bit different from what is in your schematic drawing.\n\nWhat you see is that there is a consistent value of L being used in the gr0-gr1 interface (L is consistent between through that interface). Similarly, there is a consistent (larger) value of L being used in the gr0-gr2 interface. These different values give different interface motion for the two types of interface. (There is a third value of L being used, far away from the interfaces and shown in green, but this values doesn't affect microstructural evolution because the order parameters are 1 there).",
