First, I would like to stop the grain growth after the 10th time step. Next from the 11th time step, I would like to conduct a mechanical stress analysis on the grain structure built in the 10th time step? Can this consecutive analysis be done using these way in MOOSE?\nOr is it possible to export the grain structure with grain boundaries and orientations in txt format from the grain growth model? If it is possible, would you be kind to let me know what I should include in the output system? Then, I can use this txt file for a mechanical stress analysis in a decoupled way I believe.\n\nI would appreciate if you can manage time to reply.\nBest regards",

When using restart, you can read in all of the solution fields from a previous simulation and run a \"new\" simulation. The other way you could go about this is using MOOSE's Control system. You can toggle objects on off while a simulation is running among other things with that system.\nI would not recommend trying to output all of the solution in a text format, although their is a \"vector postprocessor\" object capable of doing this if you do want to perform some of this discrete analysis. Restart is the way to go!",

                  "bodyText": "This is fairly straightforward, and there are two ways to do this. If you want to use the same grain structure (after the grain growth stage) for multiple mechanical stress analysis simulations, you can read the order parameter variables from the exodus file output of your grain growth stage using the Solution User Object .\nIf you are planning to only use each grain growth result once, it is faster to use the MultiApps system. Run the grain growth simulation as a sub-app, and return the grain order parameter variables after the grain growth step using the Transfers system.",

What am I missing?\nPlease find attached the input file.\nedo.i.txt",

I'm looking to implement strain fields using inclusion defects with the Tensor Mechanics module, while also evolving the strain with an equation under the Phase Field model which includes strain components as a full variable. However, since the Tensor Mechanics module outputs the strain tensor components as AuxVariables, I can't evolve these under the Allen-Cahn kernel as it is incompatible with AuxVariables. Is there a way around this i.e. to cast the strains from the Tensor Mechanics module as full variables, or is this not possible within the MOOSE framework? Thank you for your time",

The Phase Field problem i wish to evolve depends on different variables unrelated to that causing the strain in the Tensor Mechanics problem (basically they would result in \"competing\" strain terms). Is there a way I can directly evolve the strain in both Tensor Mechanics and Phase Field instead of any underlying material properties?",
