I have seen a few discussions about this on the forum but I am still not sure how to do this. Are there any good examples available that show how to track the motion of say a single particle as a function of time using the Ray Tracing module?",

I ll post a link when it's released\nWe will have work starting in October on particle-in-cell methods that will also do something similar\nGuillaume",

That's why i was trying to simulate it with a NeumannBC at the alpha outlet boundaries. currrently the code isn't showing any specific error codes. the residual values are just not seeming to reduce and therefore not converging.

However, I've recently acquired some field data, and I've noticed that all the extraction rates are given in terms of flux (kg/s), as opposed to maintaining a fixed pressure at the bottom of the aquifer. My question is whether there's a method to extract heat while keeping the flux fixed, rather than controlling it through pressure?\n@WilkAndy\n@cpgr\nThanks!\nJose",

If you are committed to using OpenFOAM, you can check out Cardinal's source code to see how we have wrapped NekRS inside MOOSE, and adapt to use with OpenFOAM.\nDepending on your application, you could also consider using Cardinal directly. NekRS contains capabilities for RANS, LES, and DNS using the spectral element method.\nLet me know if you have any questions, happy to help!",

          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nRecently I read the code in RadialReturnStressUpdate and got confused about a theoretical question. In RadialReturnStressUpdate the final stress is computed as:\n  if (_apply_strain)\n  {\n    strain_increment -= inelastic_strain_increment;\n    updateEffectiveInelasticStrain(_effective_inelastic_strain_increment);\n\n    // Use the old elastic strain here because we require tensors used by this class\n    // to be isotropic and this method natively allows for changing in time\n    // elasticity tensors\n    stress_new = elasticity_tensor * (strain_increment + elastic_strain_old);\n  }\n\nAccording to my understanding about the code, It seems to show when the material is in a inleastic-deformed status, the stress is only generated by the elastic strain. Or in formula it writes:\n\u03c3 = C * (\u03b5_total - \u03b5_ine - \u03b5_eigen) = C * \u03b5_e\nDoes anyone know whether my understanding right or not? Thanks!\nXiaobei",

Before it is read by moose, I also generated a IPF color map in dream3D to check if the grains are correctly shown in paraview (figure named IPF color), to make sure the data processing is correct.\nUsing the input script given in the moose named EulerAngleVariables2RGBAux.i and changing the EBSD file name, I try to read it in MOOSE, but I got the following results (shown in figure 'rgb') after opening the output from paraview.  The grain structures are generally correct but there are a few streaks.\nI also attached the EBSD file generated from dream3D (316INL.txt).  Is there some setting in Moose input script that I didn't set up correctly?\n\n\n316INL.txt",
