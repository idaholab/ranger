But I'm confused.\nAs my understanding, for example, a 1D mesh which has 10 elements. Its id is from 0 to 9. If I use getNeighborMaterialProperty in elem0, I will get the material property of elem1, in elem1 and get mat prop of elem2, right? If so, what will I get if I use it in the last element?",

I am aware these are revolving mainly around the SI units as can be seen here.).\nGoing by that, is it a valid statement that i address stresses by Pa, assuming that the length scale moose uses is 'meter' and force in kgm/s^2.\nThe main intention behind my question being that i am struggling to find the units for some of the constants mentioned in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/materials/crystal_plasticity/CrystalPlasticityKalidindiUpdate.html#!, but unable to find descriptions in the parameters section. The t_sat in that case would be literally called as 109.8 Pa if i am right.\nKind regards,\nArun",

As described under the section Units Assumed in Crystal Plasticity Materials on the Compute Multiple Crystal Plasticity Stress documentation page, the crystal plasticity models use the mm-MPa-s unit system. In addition to the documentation page, we have tried to explicitly list the assumed units in the parameter description.\nIt does look like the Kalidindi model you are referencing does not list those unit assumptions in the parameter descriptions. While we work on updating that documentation, please know that that units for that class is also in the mm-MPa-s system.\nHope this helps,\nStephanie",

          "bodyText": "This is meant to be a repository of information for designing field split conditioners for NS. When (or even before) we have options that work robustly for a range of Reynolds numbers, this should go into the MOOSE documentation\nMy general experience:\n\nJacobi for the Schur takes more iterations than something like ASM+(I)LU but it is less expensive so it often wins\nApparently boomeramg works better on high Re problems when L is large compared to ASM+(I)LU but ASM+(I)LU works better on high Re problems for small mu. This in reference to solving the momentum part of the matrix\nIf there is no diagonal, then for Jacobi for Schur, specify -pc_jacobi_type rowmax; -pc_jacobi_type rowsum appears to be terrible. Note that when using the default -pc_jacobi_type diagonal if a 0 is encountered, then 1 is used\nJacobi doesn't work for the momentum part of the matrix; not strong enough\nFor advection dominated, full factorization does not compare as poorly to lower/upper as for non-advection dominated, in fact it may be faster\nI believe for Aij matrices in PETSc that the block size is always 1. So when doing Schur problems, doing Ainv types of diag and blockdiag are equivalent and in these cases when using selfp Ainv just corresponds to the reciprocal of A's diagonal which for advection dominated leads to Sp poorly approximating S, e.g. even when doing first order upwind with a Reynolds number of 2.2 in our 2d-rc-no-slip.i channel flow problem, it takes 50-60 linear iterations to solve the Schur complement with -pc_type lu for both the outer Schur PC type and the A00 PC type\nselfp degrades with increasing Reynolds number as the diagonal of A00 is a poor representation of A00\nself with LSC preconditioning appears to be promising for stable discretizations (e.g. Q2-Q1 finite elements). It requires some PETSC development (see this MR) in order to have mesh independent scaling. The current PETSc implementation does not add corrections for stabilized discretizations such as PSPG for finite elements or Rhie-Chow for finite volumes. I'll have to see whether that is required\n\nself with LSC is indeed a great preconditioner, especially for stable C0 finite elements. See timing in #24548 (comment). When doing LSC preconditioning with a KSP solve, it is best to limit the number of outer linear solve iterations, e.g. full should be used as the factorization as opposed to upper,lower,diag, since the ksp(S,Sp) will be expensive",
