The initial condition of each small square should be phi=0+randomly generated value,\nhow to set this initial condition?\n(The following is the model I want)\n\nI found that IsolatedBoundingBoxIC can divide the whole mesh to small square/rectangular and we can set different initial condition value to each small square/rectangular, however, it seems that this initial value can only be a certain value, it can not be set as randomly generated value in a range. How can I set a randomly generated value as the initial value in each small square/rectangular?\n(The following is IsolatedBoundingBoxIC)\n\nI also found that, using RandomIC can generate random value based on some distribution as the initial condition. How can I combine this with IsolatedBoundingBoxIC to set random generated value in each small box?\n(The following is RandomIC)\n\nThank you very much,\nBest,",
