          "bodyText": "Hi dear MOOSE experts and users,\nI am simulating a large scale geomechanical model including fault. In order to avoid sharp change of the material properties near the fault, I decided to apply phase-field approach for properly modeling. But, as you probably guess, by doing so  much time is needed for convergence. Then, I just found Smoothed Finite Element, which is more or less different in creating shape function in respect to standard FEM implemented in MOOSE, but it has higher convergence rate.\nNow, I wondering to know, is there any way to control the shape functions. Since, based on the formulation of the Smoothed FEM, after obtaining the displacement using standard FEM, smoothing process is being performed on elements resulting a smooth matrix. So, I want to know whether it is possible to perform smoothing process in MOOSE.\nThank you in advance",

            "login": "reverendbedford"
          },
          "bodyText": "For better or worse some of us run apps using a full Newton solve and superlu_dist to solve the linear equations.  Typically in my group here at ANL we run \"medium sized\" jobs like this all the time on workstations.  They might take a few hours to a few days and typically involve up to a couple million dofs.  Anything larger and we move to HPC and use an iterative linear solver preconditioned by hypre.  But running jobs with superlu is much faster, assuming you have enough memory to factor the linearized system of equations.\nWe do a lot of these medium sized problems.  Here's an example -- some RVE type model of a microstructure with a bunch of inclusions providing some strength and we're pulling on it to simulate a flow curve.  I can provide the input file and mesh for those who are curious, but it uses one of the things we have in deer that's not in tensor_mechanics.\n\nIf I run this example problem on 24 ranks (~25000 dofs/rank) with the following solver block it takes about 116 minutes to run 10 time steps.\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_factor_mat_solver_package -ksp_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu superlu_dist preonly'\n\nIf I run with this solver block, which involves some new options I added over here and needs a hacked version of libmesh, the exact same problem takes 11 minutes.  So it's 10ish times faster.\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_factor_mat_solver_package -ksp_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu superlu_dist gmres'\n  l_tol = 1e-8\n\n  reuse_preconditioner = true\n  reuse_l_max_its = 50\n\nWhat the new options do is allow NonlinearProblem and the associated libmesh PetscNonlinearSolver to reuse the LU factored Jacobian from previous nonlinear iterations and even previous timesteps as the preconditioner for GMRES to continue to solve the current linearized system of equations.  The heuristic is you just keep reusing your LU decomposition until the number of GMRES iterations exceeds some number -- here 50.  At that point you just refactor the system, do your GMRES (which is just iterative refinement during this first nonlinear iteration), and then keep using that new LU decomposition as a preconditioner for awhile.\nThis is definitely a heuristic but in my experience it works very, very well because really the structure of the nonlinear equations isn't changing all that much between iterations and changes only very slowly across timesteps.  In this problem with reuse we only factor the linear system only 1 time, versus 30 times for the \"base\" set.  And I'm not the only one to have noticed how well this works: the Intel PARDISO folks have been using it for 8 years or so and it's supported in PETSc via SNESSetLagPreconditionerPersists and SNESSetLagPreconditioner, which are of course how I implemented it in the branch.\nReconfiguring things to allow preconditioner reuse within a single time step is easy.  Allowing use across multiple time steps requires a change to libmesh because right now it clears the SNES instance in between each time step.  I started a discussion over in libmesh on changing this behavior, my preliminary tests suggest it's not that hard and doesn't seem to cause any memory issues.\nSo all that said:\n\nWould anyone else find this useful?\nDoes anyone more informed than me foresee problems in not releasing the SNES instance between time steps?  If we go ahead I'll make the old \"release after every nonlinear solve\" behavior the default, but it would be good to know if MOOSE (or libmesh) somehow relies on this behavior to ensure cross-compatibility with arbitrary apps wanting to use this heuristic.",

I can't think of anything offhand that would be an issue there, other than the fact that the problem might change and the preconditioner might not be that great. In particular, we often use damage models in which we lag the damage by one step, and I imagine the performance would be hampered considerably by that.

Setting a FunctionNeumann on the inlet and proper BCs where there is a solid surface is easy enough, but the \"open\" boundary at the outlet appears to be much trickier.\nThe system I'm simulating primarily uses the application Zapdos/Crane, but I was wondering if there exists a BC in the basic MOOSE framework or in one of its modules that computes the values of a given variable on the boundary to be the same values in the elements/points adjacent to it, or perhaps something similar to this to effectively \"open\" the boundary?\nEdit: I came across \"PorousFlowOutflowBC\" which seems to do exactly what I want from the description of it, but I've never used this module before and I'm unsure of what I would need to add to my simulation to make it work, if anything. \"ChemicalOutFlowBC\" also seems like an option, but I'm confused about the porosity term.\nThank you!",

I ran a simple INS input file with a defined velocity at the inlet, no slip everywhere else, and left the outlet undefined and it produced a velocity field as expected. I used this INS exodus file as the mesh for my plasma simulation, and I have a kernel that couples my plasma species to the flow field for a \"convection\" (not sure if thats the correct term; just going off what the kernel is called). My thought process for this is that the background gas is much higher in density than the plasma species, so any plasma interactions have very little effect on the flow field. The plasma species indeed experience diffusion and advection from the electric fields. (I'm unsure if this advection is the same as what you're thinking; It seems advection & convection are often used interchangeably and mean different things in different contexts.)\nI hope this helped clarify!",

If you want no conditions on the boundary, then you have to code up BCs of the variety that @GiudGiud linked-to. Essentially you will want to write in code-form the surface terms that result when you integrate your weak form by parts. If you are working with Zapdos, I see there are a lot of *DoNothingBC classes that I wrote a very long time ago. I can't guarantee that they still work (they are probably mostly untested) but the concepts in there should be good",

I am simulating uniaxial compression for Ti6Al4V with beta phase at alpha grain boundaries. Is there anything else I can do to track this error?",

                          "bodyText": "Hi Gary, thank you for your reply. I am using ComputeFiniteStrain, which considers TaylorExpansion as default. However, from your and Wen's suggestion, I got the idea of adding use_displaced_mesh = true to all auxkernels and user objects in my input file as I had been facing convergence issues with the progress of plastic deformation. This seems to have helped definitely. Additionally, based on Guillaume's advice, I tried running in serial with lu and noticed good improvement in speed. Subsequently, I have run in parallel after making changes to the executioner block as follows:\n[Executioner]\n\n  [./TimeStepper]\n    type = IterationAdaptiveDT\n    dt = 0.001\n    growth_factor = 1.0000001\n    cutback_factor = 0.9\n    optimal_iterations = 15\n    iteration_window = 2\n    reject_large_step = true\n    reject_large_step_threshold = 0.1\n  [../]\n\n\n  type = Transient\n  nl_max_its = 15\n  scheme = bdf2\n  solve_type = PJFNK\n  petsc_options = -snes_ksp_ew\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -sub_pc_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'asm ilu'\n  l_max_its = 40\n  l_tol = 1.0e-3\n  nl_rel_tol = 1.0e-5\n  start_time = 0.0\n  num_steps = 20000\n  nl_abs_tol = 1e-5\n  automatic_scaling = true\n  scaling_group_variables = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n[]\n\n\nOverall, the simulation is much faster now. However, I've again run into the same PETSC LAPACK error but after significantly more number of time steps. I will explore other options and check.\nThanks and regards,\nRitam",
