To build MOOSE, I use the pre-installed PETSc module; everything is compiled (consistently?) using FOSS 2018a toolchain (i.e. with OpenMPI 2.1.2). However, I have the flexibility to recompile MOOSE (and its dependencies) using more recent toolchains, if that might make a performance difference.\nI have attached the build script used for the current version, so, I appreciated if you give a look, and let me know if anything can be improved.\nmoose.zip",

I suspected that SUPERLU was missing from PETSc package\nI inspected the build logs of the used module PETSc/3.11.1-foss/2018a, and searched for results of SUPERLU test; Indeed, SUPERLU is installed as part of PETSc, and is tested during the build time; see e.g. /apps/leuven/skylake/2018a/software/PETSc/3.11.1-foss-2018a/share/petsc/examples/src/snes/examples/tutorials/output/ex19_superlu.out\nThe same is true for the Cholesky solver\nI checked the group permissions on the PETSc folder, and I realized that it needed some fix.\n\nWould you please try again with your tests?",

It seems like you're trying to setup a development environment for people on your HPC.\nIn a HPC environment, I'm much more a fan of giving users the base envs (mpich, cmake, python, more or less) and having them build PETSc and libMesh. Reason being, with the continuous changes that come with MOOSE, we update libMesh and PETSc in a regular manner. The preferred practice then is for users to manage their apps on their own with a moose submodule, which could vastly change which versions of PETSc and libMesh they need.\nAn alternative would be to provide PETSc, $PETSC_DIR, and $PETSC_ARCH, which changes far less often than libMesh, and then have them build their own libMesh.\nThis is just my $0.02. I can see some validity to actually providing a compiled MOOSE for users and having them update it as your admins update it. Internally, we use spack and modules for all of our build machines. For INL's HPC services, we provide the base compiler spack and PETSc (although we're considering transitioning away from that) via spack and modules and have users (developers) compiler libMesh.",

That option doesn't do what you want. What I would do instead is use SpecifiedSmoothCircleIC and manually specify the (x,y) positions where you want each solid seed to be placed.

When running the input file attached (I replaced the water constitutive model I have with a simple elastic model), it fails in the first time step stating that there is a negative jacobian in a Quad 4 element. I have double checked the mesh file several times and it only contains hex 8 elements. I am wondering how to fix this issue for this specific geometry.\nI have tried different geometry and it only works when the thickness of the tank is increased. Also, it works if the contact block is commented out.\n3D_tank_error.zip",

When I get to testing it using the \"run_tests\" command, I run into the following error (see below).  I see two information: 1) libquadmath.so.0 is not being found, and 2) the test reports a crash (something about oversized).  I am not sure I completely understand the information and how to search specifically for this issue on the discussion forum to help resolve it.  Help to guide to resolve this problem or a pointer to another discussion question which may help me is appreciated.\n(moose) nat1840@TC-D900675:/projects/moose/test$ make -j 8\n(moose) nat1840@TC-D900675:/projects/moose/test$ ./run_tests -i always_ok -p 2\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: Working Directory: /home/nat1840/projects/moose/test/tests/test_harness\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: Running command: mpiexec -n 2 /home/nat1840/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i good.i --error --error-unused --error-override --no-gdb-backtrace\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: /home/nat1840/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt: error while loading shared libraries: libquadmath.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: /home/nat1840/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt: error while loading shared libraries: libquadmath.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\ntests/test_harness.always_ok:\ntests/test_harness.always_ok:\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: Exit Code: 127\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: ################################################################################\ntests/test_harness.always_ok: Tester failed, reason: CRASH\ntests/test_harness.always_ok:\ntests/test_harness.always_ok ......................................................

I was able to get MOOSE to build and run by manually installing gcc, which contains the libquadmath library.\nTry \"sudo apt install gcc\", then clean out and rebuild MOOSE (i.e., do a \"make clean\", then \"make -j4\" in the test directory). That worked for me, so it might solve your problem.",
