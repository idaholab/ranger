For instance, should we update to the latest version, should we modify the main file, etc.\nMany thanks!",

However I'm not sure why you are modifying ComputeEigenstrain or why you are modifying to make it possible to specify 3 different prefactors. If you want an eigenstrain that is different in different directions you can just specify how much you want for each direction in eigen_base- are you trying to do something different from that?",

In FEM code, typically two methods are used in this process:\n\nPatch test: You'll need to setup a problem that is as simple as possible in which the analytical solution is known, and the solution can be exactly matched by the basis function of your choice. For example, you can create a single-element cube, apply Dirichlet BC on one side, and apply Neumann BC on the opposite side. By applying your kernels one at a time, you can easily match the numerical solution (given by MOOSE) with the analytical solution.\nMethod of manufactured solution: This method is documented here https://mooseframework.inl.gov/python/mms.html. In essence, you will first manufacture an arbitrary, non-homogeneous solution, and then work your way back to derive the corresponding \"body force\" that would result in the manufactured solution. Even if the manufactured solution can't be exactly represented on the basis function of your choice, you should still see optimal order of convergence by looking at the appropriate error measure.\n\nLet us know if you have specific questions regarding either method.",

If this is the same HPC Cluster as this: Exodus error #29634, your HPC Admin gave horrible advice \ud83d\ude22\nOur Conda packages will work. But not nearly as well as using HPC's custom built MPI stack made specifically for that cluster.\nHowever, maybe I am wrong, and they will work just fine. I don't think anyone on my team has performed a case study on how poorly Conda MPI stack scales against INL's MVAPICH/OpenMPI stack.\n\nYes unfortunately that is the response I got. If I \"module load Miniforge3/24.1.2-0\" anytime I submit a job would that overwrite the conda MPI packages(the one I used: curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\nbash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/miniforge) or do I have to start the installation process again(with: module load Miniforge3/24.1.2-0) to get my clusters custom  MPI packages.",

Friction needs to be included, and  since multiple simulations are needed, I plan to run them on our computing cluster. Compiled dependencies using the provided scripts not Conda.\nI am testing the 3D Berkovich example in the Contact module on a single node with 8 processes and 16 threads (128 CPUs), but it is very slow. Still ongoing but the first nonlinear iteration took about 50 minutes.\nI suspect that LU preconditioner is the cause. Could that be the case? The other examples and documentation show only LU preconditioner. Are there alternative preconditioners or settings I can try to speed this up?\nBest regards\nAndris Freimanis\nedit: this is my Moose output (still running):\n*** Info ***\n/scratch/project_2004485/andris/4_engine/5_contact/3d_berkovich/indenter_berkovich_friction.i:43.3:\nThe following information occurred in the Action 'all' of type QuasiStaticSolidMechanicsPhysics.\n\nSolidMechanics Action: selecting 'incremental finite strain' formulation.\n\n\n*** Warning, This code is deprecated and will be removed in future versions:\n/scratch/project_2004485/andris/4_engine/5_contact/3d_berkovich/indenter_berkovich_friction.i:221: (Outputs/print_perf_log):\nThe parameter 'print_perf_log' is deprecated.\nUse perf_graph instead!\n\nCurrently Setting Up\n  Setting Mesh\n    Finished Reading Mesh                                                                [  3.72 s] [  386 MB]\n  Finished Setting Mesh                                                                  [  4.08 s] [  408 MB]\n  Initializing\n    Initializing Equation Systems...

Penetration is not detected for one or more secondary nodes. This could be because those secondary nodes simply do not project to faces on the primary surface. However, this could also be because contact should be enforced on those nodes, but the faces that they project to are outside the contact patch, which will give an erroneous result. Use appropriate options for 'patch_size' and 'patch_update_strategy' in the Mesh block to avoid this issue. Setting 'patch_update_strategy=iteration' is recommended because it completely avoids this potential issue. Also note that this warning is printed only once, so a similar situation could occur multiple times during the simulation but this warning is printed only at the first occurrence.\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 2.213765e-02\n\n    Computing Jacobian.......

This can be challenging for contact.\nYou ll want to avoid running very many linear iterations like it did when this happened\n    Linear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_ITS iterations 60\n\nOne way would be to set a loose linear solve tolerance. LU tends to solve very tightly so it should not be an issue. The preferred way would be to set a max number of linear iteraitons to trigger a fail faster",

Are there other preconditioners that could be used with contact, or is it only LU?\nThanks\nAndris",

Penetration is not detected for one or more secondary nodes. This could be because those secondary nodes simply do not project to faces on the primary surface. However, this could also be because contact should be enforced on those nodes, but the faces that they project to are outside the contact patch, which will give an erroneous result. Use appropriate options for 'patch_size' and 'patch_update_strategy' in the Mesh block to avoid this issue. Setting 'patch_update_strategy=iteration' is recommended because it completely avoids this potential issue. Also note that this warning is printed only once, so a similar situation could occur multiple times during the simulation but this warning is printed only at the first occurrence.\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 2.213765e-02\n\n    Computing Jacobian.......
