I am wondering if there is any update on this or at least if there is a work around that allows for periodic BCs to be applied to variables using DGKernels.\nCurrently, my system is a simple Couette shear flow velocity field applied to some conserved variables. I have used ADConservativeAdvection, but there is no full upwinding and the documentation suggests using ADDGAdvection kernels instead.\nWould a quick fix be to use the non-AD ConservativeAdvection kernel? But I guess then the conserved variables would have to be Real and I wouldn't be able to couple them with ADReal variables?",

You can assign blocks to variables to limit their domain of definition. Advisable you'll see but it's very easy to pivot from fully-coupled to multi-system fixed-point (or multiapp)\n\nalso this is a finite volume problem, right?\n\nour best solver for navier stokes is a custom linear finite volume discretization. It can scale to Ms of elements.

What I noticed is that if we integrate it in a [ICs] object all works properly, but if integrated in a [InitialCondition] object it returns all zeros --> it seems that the userobject is either called after the [Variables] and inherited [InitialCondition] definition or its information is retrieve after. Not sure if this is on purpose, but if yes, might be worth to throw a warning?\nmauro",
