          "bodyText": "Hello MOOSE Users,\nI have previously implemented dislocation transport equations using DGKernels for advection.\nThese kernels were an extension of DGConvection with custom velocity directions\nthat depend on the crystallographic directions of my problem.\nAn example can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/ngrilli/c_pfor_am/blob/main/src/dgkernels/DGAdvectionCoupled.C\nNow, I would like to add a slope limiter to mitigate some of the oscillations\nat sharp interfaces of the dislocation density variable.\nI have read the finite volume code available,\nsuch as FVAdvection and FVLimitedAdvection,\nwhere slope limiters can be easily introduced.\nI am asking whether it is possible to incorporate slope limiters into DGConvection\nand if anyone has explored this. I could not find any examples of this approach\nin the framework or modules.\nI am at an early stage of this development and would appreciate your suggestion:\nshould I implement my previous transport laws into the FV framework,\nor is there a simple way to retrofit my previous DG kernels with slope limiters?\nI don't mind about the order of the variables because I previously used the DGKernels\nwith constant monomial variables, therefore it was behaving like FV anyway.\nI am just looking for the easiest way to implement it.\nThank you very much in advance for your help.\nBest Regards,\nNicol\u00f2",

Thanks in advance\n\nthis sounds like a good idea.\nYou can create a simulation that does just this:\n\nload the output of the previous one\nuse a coupledVarThresholdSubdomainModifier to change the subdomain of the elements you want to get rid of\n\nSave the result\n\nload the output of that simulation\nuse the BlockDeletionGenerator to delete the elements in that new subdomain of the elements to get rid of\n\nyou can probably shorten this by executing coupledVarThresholdSubdomainModifier user object on FINAL at the end of your first simulation",
