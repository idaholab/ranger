I am having some issues with oscillations in the vertical component of the velocity field, see image below. The scenario for this test is just steady state with a less dense fluid sat above a denser fluid. All boundaries except the top are no-penetration (so v dot n = 0 on the boundaries of the mesh) and the pressure on the top boundary is fixed to zero (it also displays the same behaviour without applying it). I am using first order elements for all variables and running with PSPG and SUPG. This scenario is just testing that it produces a stable result, I would expect the velocities to tend to zero but instead these variations are observed and over time their magnitude increases until it will no longer solve.\nAm I missing something obvious?\nThanks,\nAlex",

But I still hava some qustions to ask.\nI create an application named parakeet to slove CFD problems, and I add my own physics in it. Now I want to use displaced mesh in input file.\nIn parakeet, The CFDCellKernel inherit Kernel.C. The CFDFaceKernel inherit DGKernel.C. The CFDBC inherit IntegratedBC.C.\nI set the displacement field to 0 and then used use_displaced_mesh=true  only in [Kernel], [DGKernel] and [BCs] respectively. The expected results should be same as if I don't add displacement. But  the results are reasonable when I only use it in [kernel], the other two situation are not as expected.\nI had tried to annotation code to find the reason. And I found that when the code in the red box was removed in the CFDFaceKernel.CPP and CFDBC.CPP, the results will be reasonable. But the removed code  is only related to the time-marching, which should only affect convergence,  not calculation results.\nI have also tried adjusting the convergence exponent to reduce the residuals to a very low level and the results are still unreasonable. So the reason for the unreasonable results is not convergence.
