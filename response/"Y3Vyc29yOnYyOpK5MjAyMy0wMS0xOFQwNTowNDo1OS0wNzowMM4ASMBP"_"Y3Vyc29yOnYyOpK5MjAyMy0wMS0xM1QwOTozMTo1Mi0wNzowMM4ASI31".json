So we need to define the flux at the boundary, which may cause the variable value not to be fixed at the boundary. Can the fixed value BC (variable value at BC is a given constant value) be used in THM?\nThank you!\nBest regard",

Could you kindly answer another question I have?\nIn ADBoundaryFlux3EqnGhostBase.C, the ghost cell variables are calculated by the type of boundary and the variables in the interior cell. And then the boundary flux is calculated by the variable in the ghost and interior cell according to the chosen numerical method. What I want to know is why the left boundary and right boundary can use the same expression.\n( flux = _numerical_flux.getFlux(iside, ielem, true, U1, U2, normal(0));)\nIn the right boundary, the ghost cell is on the right and the interior cell is on the left. This expression is exactly correct. However, in the left boundary, the ghost cell is on the left and the interior cell is on the right, so I think it should be\n( flux =_numerical_flux.getFlux(iside, ielem, false, U2, U1, normal(0));)\nIt really confused me.

To do so, I have four parameters F11, F12, F21, F22 that need to be multiplied with the nodal coordinates (x,y) of the undeformed mesh at the specific boundary.\nFor example, the four parameters are defined in the input file as:\nF11 = 0.01\nF12 = 0.01\nF21 = 0.01\nF22 = 0.01\n\nwhile the Function for the right boundary is defined as:\n[Functions]\n  # [./right_disp_x]\n  #   type = PiecewiseLinear\n  #   x = '0    1.0    2.0    3.0     4.0    5.0    6.0    7.0    8.0    9.0   10.0'\n  #   y = '0  0.003  0.006  0.009   0.012  0.015  0.018  0.021  0.024  0.027  0.030'\n  # [../]\n  [./right_disp_x]\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    total_disp_x = ${fparse ${raw F11}*x + ${raw F12}*y - x}  # (F11*x + F12*y) - x\n    dx = ${fparse ${raw total_disp_x} / 10}\n    x = '0    1.0    2.0    3.0     4.0    5.0    6.0    7.0    8.0    9.0   10.0'\n    y = '0     dx   2*dx   3*dx    4*dx   5*dx   6*dx   7*dx   8*dx   9*dx  10*dx'\n  [../]\n[]\n\nIn the above snippet I have commented out the simple Function that imposes the displacement at the boundary using\nspecific numerical values.\nAnd finally, the BCs are defined as following:\n[BCs]\n  [./bottom_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = 'bottom'\n    variable = disp_y\n    value = 0.0\n  [../]\n  [./left_x]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = 'left'\n    variable = disp_x\n    value = 0.0\n  [../]\n  [./right_x]\n    type = FunctionDirichletBC\n    boundary = 'right'\n    variable = disp_x\n    function = right_disp_x\n  [../]\n[]\n\nUnfortunately, I get the following error:\n*** ERROR ***\n/Users/georgiossoimoiris/projects/plane_stress/problems/plane_stress_plastic_DefGradBC.i:202: field node 'Functions/right_disp_x/x' does not hold a float-typed value (val=''0    1.0    2.0    3.0     4.0    5.0    6.0    7.0    8.0    9.0   10.0'')\n/Users/georgiossoimoiris/projects/plane_stress/problems/plane_stress_plastic_DefGradBC.i:203: field node 'Functions/right_disp_x/total_disp_x' does not hold a float-typed value (val='${fparse ${raw F11}*x + ${raw F12}*y - x}')\nwhich means that 'x' and 'y' are not the nodal coordinates that I need to use!\nSo, my question is: how can I get the nodal coordinates at a specific boundary and multiply them as a vector with my parameters in order to add them to my BCs as a Function incrementally??\nThank you very much,\nGeorge",

In their paper, they provided the source code to try the application yourself, which can be found under the following link:\nhttps://gitlab.com/zhangx22/concurrentvascfp\nI therefore installed MOOSE and tried to run the application, however I could do the given examples as I always ran into an error saying that their custom kernel TempDiffusion is not an registered object.\nTherefore, could somebody try to run this on their MOOSE application, as I am wondering if this is a general code problem or has something to do with my MOOSE application.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks,\nMarkus",
