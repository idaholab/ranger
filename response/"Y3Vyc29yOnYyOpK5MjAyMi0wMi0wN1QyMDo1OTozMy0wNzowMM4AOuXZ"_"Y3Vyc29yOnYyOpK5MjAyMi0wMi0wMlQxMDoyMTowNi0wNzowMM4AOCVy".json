          "bodyText": "Conda package updates for moose-mpich, moose-petsc, and moose-libmesh were merged today in #19230, and enable full MacOS Big Sur compatibility for previously unsupported Xcode and Command Line Tools versions 12.5, 13, and 13.1. This update also enables support for MacOS Monterey. The Clang compiler has also been updated to 12.0.1.\nNote that this update only applies to Intel Macs. Official M1 Apple Silicon support is on the way! Track the MOOSE issue #18954 if interested in new developments.\nTo download the new packages, please activate your MOOSE conda environment and perform the following command:\nconda update --all\n\nwhere the appropriate versions and build in the update output should be:\nPackage                  Version            Build\n=====================================================\nmoose-libmesh            2021.10.27         build_1\nmoose-mpich              3.3.2              build_8\nmoose-petsc              3.15.1             build_3\n\nNOTE that if you do not see build_1 with your libmesh package update, check your python version. If you are using 3.8 or 3.9, you will need to update instead by doing the following:\nconda install moose-libmesh moose-tools python=3.7\n\ndue to a current lack of PyQt availability in conda for Python 3.8 and 3.9.\nIf any issues with the new packages are experienced, please open a new Discussions post!",

An ADParsedMaterial block calculates the coefficient.\nI'm not completely clear whether variables linked to kernels must in all cases be non-linear, rather than auxiliary?  It seems that a 'nice' way of setting this problem up would be to set mu as an auxvariable function, which is calculated on every timestep by equation (2) in a ParsedAux block.  Alternatively, mu could be assigned as a non-linear variable and equation (2) evaluated as a material property and mu calculated through a ADMatCoupledForce block.  This seems more difficult.\nWhich is the best way of doing this, and is it the case that auxvariables can never be linked to kernel calculations?  Thanks.",

Then you can choose whether mu should be computed at the beginning or the end of a time step (matters especially for first time step), based on the execute_on of the auxkernel that computes it.\nBy the way, ADMatDiffusion doesnt do what you think here, because setting the variable to mu does compute the right term, but it places it in the wrong equation.\nYou have to think of the variable parameter as two things:\n\nit's what goes in the formula for computing that term.\nit's the name of equation (equation for C, equation for mu) that you add that term to (that term is part of the residual)\n\nSo for that kernel:\nv = mu\nvariable = C\nis more correct.

The description is general, but I apply the first method to your system at the end. Please make sure to double check all the math and derivations, as this has not be checked by anyone or anything except my best intentions.\nNote: The notations used here will correspond to those used in the Physical Review B 2008 paper from Moelans et al. and the Physical Review E paper 2018 paper from Aagesen et al.\nGoals: When selecting the parameters of a grand potential model, one aims at defining the parameters m, ,  to obtain the desired (or close to desired) values for the interfacial energy  and interfacial thickness .\nIntroduction: It is first important to state that from the Physical Review B 2008 paper from Moelans et al.,  and  are given by\n(1).   for \n(2).  \nwith  a dimensionless function, which can be approximated as\n(3).  \nfor  values around 1.5 (tabulated values also exists), and\n(4).

(3) (Valid only for  values around 1.5) to define  as\n(7).  .\nAs you described above, there are mostly two different ways to define the parameters of a grand potential model. One in which all the different interfaces use the same , another one where each interface ij has a corresponding  value. We will cover both approaches and their limitations below.\nApproach 1:  is a constant for every phase and every interface\n\nThe interfacial energies  are either provided by the literature or values are assumed by the user.\nA specific interface i1j1 is selected by the user.\nThe interfacial length for this interface  is fixed by the user.\n is also fixed by the user (1.5 is a good first guess).\n is calculated using Eq.

It is important to check that all the values of  and  are useable. For example, if , then Eq. (1) is not valid and the parameterization is incorrect. If  and  values are not satisfactory, the user should go back to step 4, 3 or maybe even step 2 of this process until reasonable values are found (not guaranteed).\n\nThis approach is the simplest, but cannot necessarily lead to useable parameters, depending on the system. In which case the second approach can be an option. It should be possible to write a python code that tests different values of parameters and follow this process to find reasonable parameters.\nApproach 2:  depends on the interface\n\nThe interfacial energies  are either provided by the literature or values are assumed by the user.\nA specific interface i1j1 is selected by the user.\nThe interfacial length for this interface is fixed by the user.\n is fixed by the user around 1.5.\nm can be derived using Eq. (6).\nNow that m is fixed, one can:\na. Fix  values within [0.53,2.5] and derive the corresponding  and  values, which would be unique to each interface. In that case, the user should make sure that the  values are reasonable.\nb. Or fix the  values and derive the  values and  values. In that case, the user should make sure that the  values obtained at the end are within a range that keep the equations valid. For example, if Eq. (5) is used to derive , then  should be within [0.53,2.5].\nc. Or fix  and derive  and  (Same comment than for b).\n\nWhen using this approach, it is important to check if the final values are reasonable and within a range in which the equations are valid. If not, then the process should restart at step 6, 4, 3, or 2. Another thing to keep in mind is that, to my knowledge, there are currently no kernel in MOOSE to use different  values for each interface. Using this approach would require the user to write their own kernel.\nApplication of approach 1 to your system\nNow, let's apply the first approach to your system, with 1-2 the matrix-precipitate interface, and 2-2 the precipitate-precipitate interface.\n\nYou provided =0.4 (matrix ) and =0.09.\nLet's select the interface 12 (matrix-precipitate).\nYou provided =0.3.\nLet's define  =1.5.\nf_o^{inter}( )=0.125.\ng( )=0.4714.\n=0.09 and m=8.\n=0.3 and  =0.516.\nUnfortunately,   is too small for the equations to be valid. we need to find another set of parameters. You will find that changing   in step 4  will not help, neither will  in step 3. However, doing this process again from step 2 by selecting interface 22 and defining =0.3 and  =1.5 provides =0.02025, m=1.8, =0.3, and  =1.125, which fall within acceptable values.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. Again, do not hesitate to re-do all the derivations before using these values.\nI hope that helped! If it did, feel free to mark this answer as a solution.",

I have tried to implement both of the schemes.\nI had the following problems:\n\nFor the case of the constant kappa parameter, the difference in the diffuse interface widths was significant.\nFor the case of the variable kappa parameter, it was problematic to get a physically meaningful solution, especially in the triple point problem. I have thought that it can lie on the denominator stabilization. But it was not only the case. Also, I have checked a condition number and tried to improve the model to decrease it. It also did not help.\n\nHighly possible it lies in the not stable behavior of the kappa derivative in the Allen-Cahn equation, see\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.024113\nFinally, it is to mention that a new preprint is published regarding this discussion. I found it very useful. The link is below\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/357580272_Comparison_of_three_different_strategies_to_introduce_anisotropic_interface_properties_in_a_multi-phase-field_model\nSo I would choose to use the first algorithm (with constant kappa parameter). It should be more expensive regarding memory usage, but it seems to converge better to the solution, especially at triple points.",

So, I tried using DiffusionFluxAux.  However, this reports the diffusivity 'k' as not existing.  I assume this is because NS::k is a functor and not a traditional material property.  Is that correct?  Do we need new versions of objects such as DiffusionFluxAux that can accept functors?\nI tried generating a parallel set of nitrogen properties as normal materials using GeneralFluidProps (adding a suffix to distinguish them).  This didn't work because one of the properties wasn't defined (e_from_something).

This will populate the auxvariables with each component of the diffusive flux. This will not handle anisotropic diffusion coefficients.

When I run it on a HPC with about 20 cores the simulation get frozen in Performing Initial Setup..... Based on this discussion, I tried less cores but still the same result. When I also try it in my local virtual machine I face the following error:\n===\n=   BAD TERMINATION OF ONE OF YOUR APPLICATION PROCESSES\n=   PID 7259 RUNNING AT alid-VirtualBox\n=   EXIT CODE: 9\n=   CLEANING UP REMAINING PROCESSES\n=   YOU CAN IGNORE THE BELOW CLEANUP MESSAGES\n\n\nMy mesh has three layers. One of them is very thin and when I try to have more nodes in this thin layer the problem pops up. I can have thicker layers with much more nodes and elements and run simulation without any problems but it seems too much nodes in a  thin part of my mesh are source of the problem. I am trying to simulation a TH model using one dirac point. I very much appreciate if anyone can give a hint. My mesh is also uploaded here.\nmesh.zip",

To not run out of memory, you can first try to use a distributed mesh --distributed-mesh. Or you can try to use less MPI processes.\nOn the cluster, we need to find what is actually taking time.\nFirst, can you please try setting more verbose output. I think it's done like this, not sure:\n[Outputs]\n  [./screen]\n    type = Console\n    verbose = true\n    time_precision = 6\n  [../]\n[]\n\nThen, are you refining this layer in the MOOSE simulation? How? I dont think the refinement is the problem because there is a console output for that that you would have seen, but it's a commonly slow thing which we can accelerate with certain options.\nFinally, is it truly frozen or is there a continuous output of points? Performing Initial Setup.... should gain a new point every like 5 seconds if it's still doing work\nGuillaume",

About refinement, I did it in the mesh genertaor (GMSH). It is a bit strange because I only have problem when the target layers is thin and lots of nodes are whithin this thin layer.
