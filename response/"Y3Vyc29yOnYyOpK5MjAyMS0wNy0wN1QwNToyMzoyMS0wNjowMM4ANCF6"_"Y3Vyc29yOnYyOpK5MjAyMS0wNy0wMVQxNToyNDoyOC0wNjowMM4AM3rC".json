Shift the mesh slightly (eg xmin = 0.1 in the Mesh block) and it should work (injection is through the area of the cylinder like you had above). You can use an AreaPostProcessor to compute the surface area of the sink for you and compute the flux for your sink in a function.",

Checkout test/tests/dgkernels, I haven't looked at them in depth but just glancing I'm seeing 3d_diffusion, ad_dg_convection, advection_diffusion_mixed_bcs.",

It doesn't look like compile.\n\n\nIf I recompile the application with the MOOSE module,\nI got error messages like below.\n\n\n\nI asked this to HPC staff as well, and wait for his reply. But I don't know why this happens.\nFor your information, I run a simulation on HPC by using this bash file.\n\nUsually, I do not comment out the load module command line.. (2nd one, latest MOOSE)\nI knew without loading the MOOSE module, above bash file works.\nLet me clear....\n\"How I fix the compiling problem on HPC in this situation?\"\n\"What is the function of Module on HPC? I thought Module let me use the virtual environment.\nI thought If I load \"MOOSE module\", then even without local MOOSE file,\nI could make new application (./moose/scirpts/stork.sh app_name), but actually it doesn't work.\nIs there any documents for how module works or what is module on HPC?\"\nI always appreciate your help!",

The transfer will be for the non-linear variables between the apps, pressure and displacement which is not possible because the transfer is allowed only for auxVariables.\nThe fluid flow materApp is structured in a way that the material objects call a porous-media dictator that combines the non-linear variables. It is needed for populating the coupled fluid properties, e.g. density, viscosity,\u2026 which are function of nonlinear variables, e.g., pressure. That pressure is updated while the solution proceeds and the dictator\u2019s job is to pass that updated field to these materials\u2019 objects to be reevaluated.\nIn our workflow, we need to update the fluid-flow coupled properties which depends on the mechanics attributes, e.g. strain, porosity, and pore volume as a result of the updated results from the mechanics app \u2013 displacement. I tried to enforce the displacement as auxVariables. As per the following error, the dictator did not allow combining the displacement as auxVariables. So, based on my understanding, we should rewrite that dictator in a way that can facilitate accepting the auxVariables. Another option is to store the mechanics auxVariables (displacements) to fake nonlinear variables which will require a non-needed additional kernels.\n\n\nI need also to copy the pressure as a non linear variable in an auxVariable so I can pass it to the subApp. Do you have a suggestion for that?\nDo you have suggestions for those two points!",

He is going to break the poro_elasticity/mandel.i input up into a multiapp.   The poro-elasticity problem would then be two separate problems, elasticity by itself on the subapp and darcy flow on the main app.  The main app would send pressure to the subapp and the subapp would send displacements back to the main app.  The main app would use the displacement auxvariables received form the subapp as to compute a new porosity.  The main app will probably also need to solve for the other derivatives that are found in PoroFullSatMaterial.C.

Anyways, I'm building MOOSE from scratch using https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/conda.html\nEverything works perfectly/as expected until I execute \"./run_tests -j 4\" at which point all tests fail. The error given for basically all tests is FAILED (Application not found).\nI followed the troubleshooting guide https://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/troubleshooting.html#failingtests. However, the \"Application not found\" issue does not seem to be the problem? Make works, and a valid moose_test-opt is present, which can be executed and run a sample problem. I performed all the debugging in the Build section (hello world, etc). Everything seems fine?\nNeed help understanding why all tests are failing and any suggestions how to fix it.

It relies on various information from the platform, the directory structure and can be influenced by the \"testroot\" file too. There haven't been any changed merged to the TestHarness or testers in the last 2-3 months.\nWhat I would suggest is that we attempt to printout what the TestHarness \"thinks\" the name of the binary should be and go from there.
