          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI've been trying to run INS simulations with various open flow type geometries. For instance, flow around a circular cylinder, or flow over a flat plate.\nUsing the lu preconditioner, I am able to run simulations even at high Reynolds numbers (I'm wanting to experiment up to around Re~1e6).\nHowever, even at much lower Reynolds numbers, I have been unable to achieve convergence of the linear solves using any preconditioner besides lu.\nI am hoping to simulate some large meshes in future and I gather that whilst robust, lu is very memory intensive. Therefore, I would like to have the option to use some other preconditioner better suited to large problems.\nGenerally speaking, I have seen no difference between steady and transient solves.\nFor transient solves, I have also tried ramping the viscosity so that the simulation starts with a low Reynolds number, then gradually increasing it with time.\nWhilst the residual starts off smaller, the convergence appears to be no better even at the first time step.\nWorth mentioning among the options I have tried so far, I noticed that adjusting pc_factor_levels with ilu did not seem to make a difference.\nHowever, from my understanding, the more 'levels of fill' with ilu, the closer its resemblance to lu?\nI would therefore expect to see some difference, and wonder if I am misunderstanding something about what ilu is doing.\nI have also read through #16113 and tried:\npetsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_asm_overlap -sub_pc_type -sub_pc_factor_levels  -ksp_gmres_restart'\npetsc_options_value = 'bjacobi      2               ilu          4       200'\n\nand a few variations, but no avail.\nIn my related thread #23274, GiudGiud suggests that something involving FSP could be helpful here; however, in #16113, lindsayad mentions that he's found asm and bjacobi to be better for INS problems.\nAny advice on where I should look here would be greatly appreciated. Choosing appropriate preconditioners still seems something of a mystery to me at times!\nFor what it's worth, below is an example input file in case there are other mistakes I'm making!\nThanks!\nfilename = exampleFile\nvelocity_x = 5 # 5 for Re=5million at x=1\n\n[Mesh]\n    [base]\n        type = FileMeshGenerator\n        file = ./mesh/FlatPlateMesh_2D.msh\n    []\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n    [velocity]\n        family = LAGRANGE_VEC\n        block = 'fluid'\n    []\n    [pressure]\n        block = 'fluid'\n    []\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n    [velocity]\n        type = VectorConstantIC\n        x_value = ${velocity_x}\n        y_value = 1e-13\n        variable = velocity\n    []\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n    # [mu]                         #Use this to try ramping Re in transient solves\n    #     type = ParsedFunction\n    #     value = 'if (t <= 0.5, 1.789e-5 - ((t-0.1)*(1.789 - 1.789e-5)/0.1), 1.789e-5)'    #Ramps from 1.7e-2 to 1.7e-5\n    # []\n    [mu]                           #Fixed mu for SS solves\n        type = ParsedFunction\n        value = '1.789e-5'\n    []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n    [fluid] # Air, ISA sea lvl\n        type = ADGenericFunctionMaterial\n        prop_names = 'rho mu T cp k'\n        prop_values = '1.225 mu 288 1005 0.02596'\n        block = 'fluid'\n    []\n    [ins_mat]\n        type = INSADStabilized3Eqn\n        velocity = velocity\n        pressure = pressure\n        temperature = '288'\n        block = 'fluid'\n        alpha = 1.0\n    []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n    [mass_conservation]\n        type = INSADMass\n        variable = pressure\n    []\n    # [momentum_time]\n    #     type = INSADMomentumTimeDerivative\n    #     variable = velocity\n    # []\n    [momentum_advection]\n        type = INSADMomentumAdvection\n        variable = velocity\n    []\n    [momentum_pressure]\n        type = INSADMomentumPressure\n        variable = velocity\n        pressure = pressure\n    []\n    [momentum_viscous]\n        type = INSADMomentumViscous\n        variable = velocity\n    []\n\n    [momentum_supg]\n        type = INSADMomentumSUPG\n        variable = velocity\n        velocity = velocity\n    []\n    [mass_pspg]\n        type = INSADMassPSPG\n        variable = pressure\n    []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n    [inlet]\n        type = VectorDirichletBC\n        values = '${velocity_x} 0 0'\n        variable = velocity\n        boundary = 'inlet'\n    []\n    [outlet]\n        type = ADDirichletBC\n        value = 0\n        variable = pressure\n        boundary = 'outlet'\n    []\n    [free_slip]\n        type = ADVectorFunctionDirichletBC\n        variable = velocity\n        boundary = 'bottom_upstream top'\n        function_y = 0\n        set_x_comp = False\n        set_y_comp = True\n        set_z_comp = False\n    []\n    [no_slip_wall]\n        type = VectorDirichletBC\n        values = '0 0 0'\n        variable = velocity\n        boundary = 'plate'\n    []\n[]\n\n[Preconditioning]\n    [precond]\n        type = SMP\n        full = true\n    []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n    type = Steady\n    # dt = 0.0025\n    # end_time = 1\n    solve_type = NEWTON\n    nl_rel_tol = 1e-10\n    nl_max_its = 35\n    l_tol = 1e-10\n    l_max_its = 50\n    automatic_scaling = true\n    line_search = default\n\n    #These petsc options work:\n    petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_factor_shift_type'      \n    petsc_options_value = 'lu       NONZERO'\n\n\n    #Uncomment below for transient solves\n\n    # dtmax = 0.0025\n    # [TimeStepper]\n    #     type = IterationAdaptiveDT\n    #     # dt = 1E-5\n    #     dt = 0.0001\n    #     growth_factor = 1.5\n    #     cutback_factor = 0.8\n    # []\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n    [OutputFile]\n        type = Exodus\n        file_base = ${filename}\n    []\n[]",

I haven't found much detail in the docs on what the differences are so this has been trial and error so far...\nMany of the suggestions, including Max's above, involve Schur's complement. From what I have read in the Petsc docs, it seems that whilst there are built-in methods, preconditioning of the Schur's complement matrix itself is non-trivial and often problem specific?\nAnother general observation which I'm not sure I was expecting, is that the convergence is completely different using FSP with, say, both variables preconditioned with ilu, compared to straight ilu with no field split.\nIs this because the systems are decoupled in some way? (Perhaps 'decoupled' is the wrong word here - what I'm getting at is that it's hard to picture how two coupled variables are being isolated in separately preconditioned systems)\nAfter looking at the FV bits linked to, I wonder if you can clarify one more thing for me:\nWhat is the SMP preconditioner acting on? The fact we define both the SMP block, then separately some other preconditioners suggestes they operate on different systems, and I'm interested to know roughly what's going on here.",

          "bodyText": "I am trying to implement an adaptive time stepping scheme based on the change of value of one or more of my internal state variables (AuxVariables). I looked up the manual and it says that the option timestep_limiting_processor enables one to specify a list of postprocessor values used as an upper limit for the current time step length. I am very much confused by this without further examples. Suppose I want to make sure that the time step size is such that the variable xalpha does not change by more than 10^-3 over a time step. Should the corresponding specification be something like the following?\n[Executioner]\n   ...\n    [TimeStepper]\n    type = IterationAdaptiveDT\n    dt = 1.0e2\n    optimal_iterations = 20\n    iteration_window = 10\n    linear_iteration_ratio = 100\n    force_step_every_function_point = true\n    timestep_limiting_postprocessor = dt_pp\n  []\n[]\n...\n[Postprocessor]\n  [xalpha]\n    type = ElementIntegralVariablePostprocessor\n    variable = xalpha\n    use_displaced_mesh = false\n  []\n  [dxalpha]\n    type = ChangeOverTimePostprocessor\n    postprocessor = xalpha\n  []\n  [dt]\n    type = TimestepSize\n  []\n  [dt_pp]\n    type = ParsedPostprocessor\n    constant_names = target_delta\n    constant_expressions = 1e-3\n    pp_names = 'dt dxalpha xalpha'\n    function = 'dt*target_delta/dxalpha'\n  []\n[]\n\nAlso, I tried to play around with options. I notice that with a setting of dtmin = 1 and dtmax = 1e6, whenever I have this postprocessor on, the time step size would drop to dtmin = 1, then double until it reaches 64, and drops all the way to 1 again, repeating itself. For my problem at hand this will be exceedingly slow. I wonder if there's any way to rectify this and not have it reset to dtmin whenever I need it to decrease? Thank you.",

There's a window where the dt is constant, and if the solver takes more than N + window_size non linear iterations, the time step decreases.\nSimilarly, if the solver takes less than N-window_size NL iterations to converge, the time step increases\nGuillaume",
