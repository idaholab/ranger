          "bodyText": "The POD Reduced Basis Surrogate Example fails when run in parallel.\nThe example code in moose/modules/stochastic_tools/examples/surrogates/pod_rb/2d_multireg has .i files for a full_order model to run on 1000 samples, a trainer on 100 samples, and a surrogate emulating the full_order model on the same 1000 samples. When properly run the outputs of the full_order and the surrogate models agree to about 5 decimal digits.\nThe example codes cannot be run in place using the code generated by the Makefile in the stochastic_tools module because the MaterialReaction and PODSurrogateTester codes are not included. They are provided only in the stochastic_tools/test folder. I created a moose app with stork, modified its Makefile for STOCHASTIC_TOOLS            := yes and copied the supplementary test code to the app's include and src folders. With these modifications, I was able to run all of the .i files with a single processor on an M1 MAC and on an AWS Linux partition.\nWhen I try to run the trainer with mpiexec -n 8, it runs through the first half of the training and reports errors in the second half, I include the output from the end of the first half through the failure:\nsub12: \nsub12: Postprocessor Values:\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: | time           | nodal_l2       |\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: |   0.000000e+00 |   0.000000e+00 |\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: \nsub12:       0 Linear |R| = 1.501988e+03\nsub12:       1 Linear |R| = 5.483291e+01\nsub12:       2 Linear |R| = 2.983655e-01\nsub12:       3 Linear |R| = 4.760389e-03\nsub12:  Solve Converged!\nsub12: \nsub12: Outlier Variable Residual Norms:\nsub12:   psi: 1.501988e+03\nsub12: \nsub12: Postprocessor Values:\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: | time           | nodal_l2       |\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: |   0.000000e+00 |   0.000000e+00 |\nsub12: |   1.000000e+00 |   1.778131e+04 |\nsub12: +----------------+----------------+\nsub12: \nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 13/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 26/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 39/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 52/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 64/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 76/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 88/100 samples complete!\nPODFullSolveMultiApp [sub] 100/100 samples complete!\n      Finished Executing MultiApps                                                       [  2.37 s] [  895 MB]\n    Finished Executing MultiApps                                                         [  2.37 s] [  895 MB]\n  Finished Executing MultiApps                                                           [  2.37 s] [  895 MB]\n Solve Skipped!\n\n\n*** ERROR ***\n/Users/rogerfrye/Documents/Git/multi_ai/problems/POD_trainer.i:56.3:\nThe following error occurred in the MultiApp 'sub' of type PODFullSolveMultiApp.\n\nInternal error, a processor has an undefined app.\n\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 5\n\n\n*** ERROR ***\n/Users/rogerfrye/Documents/Git/multi_ai/problems/POD_trainer.i:56.3:\nThe following error occurred in the MultiApp 'sub' of type PODFullSolveMultiApp.\n\nInternal error, a processor has an undefined app.\n\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 6\n\n\n*** ERROR ***\n/Users/rogerfrye/Documents/Git/multi_ai/problems/POD_trainer.i:56.3:\nThe following error occurred in the MultiApp 'sub' of type PODFullSolveMultiApp.\n\nInternal error, a processor has an undefined app.\n\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 7\nmpiexec -n 8 ../multi_ai-opt -i POD_trainer.i  0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 8.589 total\n\n\nThis error does not show up when num_rows in the trainer is less than 15 or for certain other values like 50 and 60.

          },
          "bodyText": "Dear Moose Experts,\nI am currently attempting to replicate a crystal plasticity-phase field coupled model as described in the paper \"On the plastic driving force of grain boundary migration: A fully coupled phase field and crystal plasticity model\". The authors have claimed that this model has already been implemented in MOOSE/MARMOT. However, in my own implementation of the crystal plasticity-phase field coupled model, I have encountered prolonged computation time for Jacobian and residual calculation when the simulation reaches \"Time Step 75, time = 3.27713, dt = 0.0855946\", compared to the time steps before.\n\nSpecifically, according to the description of the coupling method outlined by the authors (see Sec 2.4 coupling method), at the grain boundaries or interfaces, it is necessary to compute individual crystal plasticity models for each activated grain or order parameter (GrainTracker), followed by the construction of kernels (StressDivergenceTensors) using the weighted average Cauchy stress and Jacobian matric.\nTo achieve this coupling model, based on the crystal plasticity modelsComputeElasticityTensorCP, ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress, and CrystalPlasticityKalidindiUpdate provided in the example file exception.i, I have extended the paradigm to consider multiple crystal plasticity models for each activated grain at every quadrature point. The specific construction approach is illustrated in the attached diagram,\n\nThe main idea is to extend the state parameters in the crystal plasticity constitutive model to vector types, where the size of the vector-type material parameters corresponds to the number of order parameters. The material parameters associated with each grain include elastic tensor, rotation matrix, plastic deformation gradient, second Piola-Kirchhoff stress, Cauchy strain, and Jacobian matrix. The existing material parameters in MOOSE's crystal plasticity constitutive model are replaced with the aforementioned material parameters indexed by order parameters. At each quadrature point, after computing the crystal plasticity models corresponding to each activated order parameter, weighted Cauchy stresses _stress[_qp] and Jacobian matrices _Jacobian_mult[_qp] are used to construct the kernel based on the weighting method proposed in the paper.\nIn summary, the above is my approach to constructing the coupled model based on the coupling method described in the paper. The current issue I am facing is the prolonged computation time for Jacobian and residual calculation at approximately 3.3 seconds, where the run time is 1552.32 seconds, whereas before 3.3 seconds, the run time was less than 5.0 seconds. I am seeking assistance in understanding the reasons behind the extended computation time at \"Time Step 75\".\nI would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions from the community to help resolve this issue.\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.\nBest regards,\nWei",

Strangely, the simulation of crystal plasticity-phase field coupling proceeded as expected, with grain boundaries migrating under elastic driving forces, as shown below:\n\nHowever, when setting 'ao = 0.001' to activate plasticity in the constitutive model, the simulation still encountered a significant computational process during the time step calculation, indicated by the display of 'Residual' in the terminal as follows:\nTime Step 8, time = 0.108816, dt = 0.020736\n\nGrain Tracker Status:\nGrains active index 0: 1 -> 1\nGrains active index 1: 1 -> 1\n\nFinished inside of GrainTracker\n\n    Computing Residual.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nTherefore, I suspect that the need for long-duration residual calculations arises from the plastic constitutive model in the mechanical model.

However, at Time Step 28, another order parameter (gr1) is activated, requiring the calculation of a new crystal plasticity constitutive model with the same total deformation gradient. However, the output indicates that the slip increment in the newly created constitutive model far exceeds its maximum allowable value (0.02). We believe this discrepancy leads to the failure of constitutive solving.\nThis situation is akin to suddenly applying a large load or strain, rather than a gradually increasing strain rate load. To validate this hypothesis, we created a simplified case based on exception.i considering only crystal plasticity mechanics, where boundary conditions are set as follows:\n  [tdisp]\n    type = FunctionDirichletBC\n    variable = uy\n    boundary = top\n    function = 'if(t<0.2, 0.0, 0.05)'\n  []\nThis case still encounters the same issue and displays identical error messages. Thus, we believe this simple case confirms our suspicion that the newly created crystal plasticity model fails to converge numerically when subjected to a sudden large total deformation gradient, instead of a gradual strain rate.\nIn conclusion, within crystal plasticity-phase field coupling simulations, when activating new order parameters, new crystal plasticity constitutive models need to be continuously created. While the total deformation gradient remains the same at each quadrature point, elastic and plastic deformation gradients, as well as internal state variables, vary. This was confirmed in discussion with Professor Michael R. Tonks.\nGiven your extensive experience in writing crystal plasticity constitutive models, do you have any suggestions regarding this issue?\nI would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions from the community to help resolve this issue.\nWei",

The Kalidindi model is a fairly simple crystal plasticity model, and it likely does not have all the dislocation motion mechanisms necessary to accommodate a large sudden load. The crystal plasticity models that we have in main MOOSE are much more suited to lower loading rates because they are built using the quasi-static assumptions.\nIf you are still continuing with the simulation, a couple of options you might try, either separately or in combination:\n\ngradually apply the load to the crystal plasticity model\nchange the tolerance on the maximum slip tolerance rate (I wouldn't be comfortable with a slip increment of 1e+6 personally, but you might increase the tolerance amount some to allow the simulation to run)\n\nI know you had previously tried to apply suggestion 1. with substepping and ran into a hanging simulation. You might try to more explicitly trying this substepping by providing the crystal plasticity model simulation, maybe with a MultiApp approach that might allow the crystal plasticity model to take a much smaller timestep than the phase field model.\nHope this helps, or, that since I took so long to respond, that you have already found a suitable solution for this problem,\nStephanie\np.s. your Schmid tensor (the flow direction tensor) looks odd to me--have you checked to ensure that Schmid tensor calculation is giving the result you expect?",

I've prepared a simple example to demonstrate but the goal is to eventually\n\nbenchmark with USGS Hydrotherm Code\ncouple this to a Navier Stokes flow model multiapp of flow of magma in the dike\nconjugate heat transfer with magma in the dike cooling\n\nThe problem is as follows:\nA dike intrudes into granite host rock at temperature of 500 C. It  is a constant temperature BC for 2 (6.3e7 s) then shuts off and cools (Neuman BC, value = 0).\nThe boundary at the dike is impermeable to flow (NeumanBC for porepressure).\nI've expanded the domain to include what I consider the \"far field\" so the right most boundaries\nshould be uneffected by the dike heating (4000m).\nThe simulation stops at 200 m depth and goes down to 2000 m depth. There is a hydrostatic pressure gradient and geothermal temperature gradient. Water is the only fluid phase.\nSo far to deal with convergence issues I've tried the following\n\nUsing PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink BCs instead of DirichletBC - This helped it run longer\nUsing SimpleFluidProperties instead of Water97FluidProperties - This helps the simulation runs to  completion and works fine but I'd like to use water properties and especially want to look at multiphase effects and benchmarking\nChanging permeablitiy - Decreasing permeability to 1e-15 causes it to fail to converge after only a few timesteps\nTrying different BCs such as `PorousFlowOutflowBC' didn't help.\nAdding dampers to pressure and temperature. This helps a bit but not in the long run since it will eventually cause convergence issues becuase I keep getting unphysical pressure.\nRamping up temperature (enthalpy) slowly over time - it stops converging when the temperature reaches a critical point and phase chanage occurs ~5000-10000 seconds\nconstant capillary pressure with pc = 0\nIf i lower the enthalpy BC to a level with no phase change it converges fine and runs to completion\nreducing nl_abs_tol to as low as 1e-4, still convergence issues associated with steam\n\nI believe this is a boundary condition issue because when I get problems with pressure or temperature out of bounds (dampers off) it usually occurs on the top right corner or left corner.\nIs this boundary conditions, initial conditions (try an IC with some steam initially?), or maybe capillary pressure?\nThings I've observed that seem strange to me :\n\ndespite scaling the residual for enthalpy \"h\" is often much larger than for pressure and increases faster, Does it need more BCS?\nsimulation reaches a point where there is no change in residual despite iterations for example:\n\n\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -2191180.71139573 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 441: (x,y,z)=(     100,     -380,        0)\n 6 Nonlinear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      0 Linear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.601581e-09\n Damping factor: 0\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 25.6896\n                    h:       2.59769e+06\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -2191180.71139573 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 441: (x,y,z)=(     100,     -380,        0)\n 7 Nonlinear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      0 Linear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.601581e-09\n Damping factor: 0\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 25.6896\n                    h:       2.59769e+06\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -2191180.71139573 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 441: (x,y,z)=(     100,     -380,        0)\n 8 Nonlinear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      0 Linear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.601581e-09\n Damping factor: 0\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 25.6896\n                    h:       2.59769e+06\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -2191180.71139573 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 441: (x,y,z)=(     100,     -380,        0)\n 9 Nonlinear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      0 Linear |R| = 2.597688e+06\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.601581e-09\n\n\nHere is a simplified version of the input file:\n# can you have an adaptive BC?\n# perfectly matched layers \n# check the pressures at the BC and the flux through the boundary \n# doesn't have to be atmospheric\n\n# nusselt number \n# scaling \n# heat flux at surface - can caluculate it from space \n# what is the thermal annomaly from space?\n\n#trying nonzero cap pressure \n# might have issues because cap pressure is infinite when sat water is low \n# BC pressure is what is used in the watervapor.i model\n\n\n[Mesh]\n    [gen]\n      type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n      dim = 2\n      nx = 20\n      ny = 20\n      xmin = 0\n      xmax = 4000\n      ymax = -200\n      ymin = -2000\n    []\n    [dike]\n      type = ParsedGenerateSideset\n      input = gen\n      combinatorial_geometry = 'y <= -400 & x = 0'\n      new_sideset_name = dike\n    []\n\n  []\n  \n  [Dampers]\n    [./limit]\n      type = BoundingValueNodalDamper\n      variable = pliquid\n      max_value = 1e8\n      min_value = 1e1\n    [../]\n    [./limit2]\n        type = BoundingValueNodalDamper\n        variable = h\n        max_value = 1e6\n        min_value = 1e2\n\n    [../]\n  []\n\n  [GlobalParams]\n    PorousFlowDictator = dictator\n    gravity = '0 -9.81 0'\n  []\n\n  [UserObjects]\n    [dictator]\n      type = PorousFlowDictator\n      porous_flow_vars = 'pliquid h'\n      number_fluid_phases = 2\n      number_fluid_components = 1\n    []\n    [pc] #from porousflow/test/tests/fluidstate/watervapor.i\n      type = PorousFlowCapillaryPressureBC\n      pe = 1e5\n      lambda = 2\n      pc_max = 1e6\n    []\n    [fs]\n      type = PorousFlowWaterVapor\n      water_fp = water97 #

I'm hoping to get this written up for my dissertation for graduation in June so I really appreciate your time and attention on this. I appreciate that this is a free community with a lot of great documentation and resources.\n\n\nOne of the issues I was having was the classic \"Pressure out of bounds\", the solution normally would be to use TabulatedFluidProperties however PorousFlowWaterVapor userobject does not work with tabulated fluid properties. So I've rewritten Water97FluidProperties to remove the MooseException on out of bound so it just gives a warning instead. I know this might lead to unphysical results but I had to try something.\n\n\nI tried with SVD with this new fluid properties and doesn't have any singular values but the condition number was high (4.7e9) so I added automatic scaling but this time with compute_scaling_once=false in hopes this would address the problem I mentioned above where the residual for h becomes much larger than the residual for pliquid. This does seem to help but I still get issues when I get to the critical temperature\n\n\nHere's an example of what the convergence looks like:\nPostprocessor Values:\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| time           | max_gassat     | max_temp       |\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n:                :                :                :\n|   4.032963e+02 |   0.000000e+00 |   3.630635e+02 |\n|   4.032963e+02 |   0.000000e+00 |   3.630635e+02 |\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -3.91568755730987e-06 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 0: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -2000,        0)\nMesh unchanged, skipping remaining steps...\n\nTime Step 28, time = 403.296, dt = 1.81899e-09\nPre-SMO residual: 8.63758e-06\n\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\n\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 0.000598393\n                    h:       1.70492e-06\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -0.000179414795588558 'pliquid' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 106: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -1550,        0)\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 5.983956e-04\n      0 Linear |R| = 5.983956e-04\n      1 Linear |R| = 2.427520e-05\n      2 Linear |R| = 5.028450e-06\n      3 Linear |R| = 1.306079e-06\n      4 Linear |R| = 1.867992e-07\n      5 Linear |R| = 2.200727e-08\n      6 Linear |R| = 5.238316e-09\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 1.95181e+06\n                    h:       2.61064e+48\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] 2.61063768205785e+48 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 0: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -2000,        0)\n 1 Nonlinear |R| = 2.610638e+48\nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_DTOL iterations 1\n Solve Did NOT Converge!\nAborting as solve did not converge\n\nSolve failed, cutting timestep.\n\nTime Step 28, time = 403.296, dt = 9.09495e-10\nPre-SMO residual: 6.00394e-06\n\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\n\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 0.000328146\n                    h:       9.35113e-07\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -9.84100512907783e-05 'pliquid' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 106: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -1550,        0)\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 3.281475e-04\n      0 Linear |R| = 3.281475e-04\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.454876e-05\n      2 Linear |R| = 3.509655e-06\n      3 Linear |R| = 9.578692e-07\n      4 Linear |R| = 1.816085e-07\n      5 Linear |R| = 3.547549e-08\n      6 Linear |R| = 4.969955e-09\n      7 Linear |R| = 1.588303e-09\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 1.95181e+06\n                    h:       2.61064e+48\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] 2.61063768198739e+48 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 0: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -2000,        0)\n 1 Nonlinear |R| = 2.610638e+48\nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_DTOL iterations 1\n Solve Did NOT Converge!\nAborting as solve did not converge\n\nSolve failed, cutting timestep.\n\nTime Step 28, time = 403.296, dt = 4.54747e-10\nPre-SMO residual: 4.79489e-06\n\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\n\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 0.00019397\n                    h:       5.50038e-07\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] -5.91104849096966e-05 'pliquid' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 106: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -1550,        0)\n 0 Nonlinear |R| = 1.939710e-04\n      0 Linear |R| = 1.939710e-04\n      1 Linear |R| = 1.074573e-05\n      2 Linear |R| = 2.636189e-06\n      3 Linear |R| = 9.424006e-07\n      4 Linear |R| = 1.956206e-07\n      5 Linear |R| = 5.982122e-08\n      6 Linear |R| = 7.405004e-09\n      7 Linear |R| = 1.980791e-09\n      8 Linear |R| = 6.424076e-10\n    |residual|_2 of individual variables:\n                    pliquid: 1.95181e+06\n                    h:       2.61064e+48\n[DBG][0] Max 1 residuals\n[DBG][0] 2.61063768196143e+48 'h' in subdomain(s) {''} at node 0: (x,y,z)=(       0,    -2000,        0)\n 1 Nonlinear |R| = 2.610638e+48\nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_DTOL iterations 1\n Solve Did NOT Converge!\nAborting as solve did not converge\n\nSolve failed, cutting timestep.",

The issues is pretty simple: TabulatedFluidProperties inherits from SinglePhaseFluidProperties and Water97FluidProperties overrides and implements triplePointPressure() and several other functions. So the fix would be for TabulatedFluidProperties to check for those implementations in _fp and use the ones implemented there and if there isn't one it would need to read another column from TFP file with a couple more things like triple point pressure, temperature, something with vapor pressure and vapor temperature, etc. I think that would work but could use a pointer in the right direction.",

Then it transfers the data to the sub-problem and solves it in the same way, i.e., by iterating and checking for convergence.\nHow can I set up a framework like this:\n\nRun the first Newton iteration for the main-problem.\nTransfer the data from the main problem to the sub-problem.\nRun the first Newton iteration for the sub-problem.\nCheck for convergence and repeat step 1 for the next Newton iteration until both solutions converge, then move to the next loading/time step.\n\nAnother question: Is transferring data between different apps expensive?",

With that not being the case, maybe we should see how WASP was linked instead.\nCan you peruse around in moose/framework/contrib/wasp/install/lib, and run a couple more ldds on the libraries in there, see if you detect any oddities with the way those libraries linked?\nFailing any oddities, I think then I need to bug @brandonlangley for another helpful eye.",
