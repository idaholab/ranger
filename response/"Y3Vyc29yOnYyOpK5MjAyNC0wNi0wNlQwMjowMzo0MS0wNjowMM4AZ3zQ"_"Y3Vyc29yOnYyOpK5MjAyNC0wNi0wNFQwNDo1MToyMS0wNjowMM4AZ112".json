Is there a way to take the gradient or directional derivative of a material property inside the kernel and/or the materials system? If not, what is the best way to implement this?\nIt seems like this would be straightforward to do in an AuxKernel, but the material property is dependent on the gradient of the kernel variable (_grad_u) and should be compatible with automatic differentiation (AD) to be computed inside the kernel.\nAnother solution would be to use adCoupledGradient() to retrieve the gradient of this material property, and while I am new to MOOSE, from my understanding this applies only to coupled variables and not to material properties.\nThank you! Let me know if you need any more information or clarification.",

So the projection is not as straightforward anymore\nFrom there:\n\neither derive a new polynomial family adapted to your geometry\ncreate a bijective mapping from your geometry to a cylinder and modify the code to use it for the projection and the reconstruction\nor make corrections to the current one to account for non orthogonality\n\nYou will want to work on a simple geometry to do this again. Either an ellipse or a square. Once it works there, you can move on to your complex shape",
