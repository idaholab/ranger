          "bodyText": "Hi, I didn't see any related discussions on this board so I'm posting a new one on this topic.\nI'm trying to implement a viscoelastic material into RACCOON for fracture simulation. The only related documentation for RACCOON that allows for viscoelasticity without plasticity that I saw is ComputeLargeDeformationStress which takes in an elasticity and viscoelasticity model.\nHowever, some other aspects of the RACCOON + viscoelastic marriage weren't clear. For example, ComputeLargeDeformationStress requires finite deformation measures, and those viscoelastic models that use finite strain measures require cree updates, and it's not clear how to include creep updates in the RACCOON framework. I'm wondering if anyone's seen some documentation anywhere that goes into this in a bit more detailed manner.\nHere's my input file, though there's an ADerror as it stands now:\n*** ERROR ***\n...:173.3:\nThe following error occurred in the MaterialBase 'stress' of type ComputeLargeDeformationStress.\n\nThe declared AD material property 'stress' of type 'RankTwoTensorTempl<double>'\nis already retrieved or declared as a non-AD property of type 'RankTwoTensorTempl<double>'.\n\n`E = 660e6\nnu = 0.3\nK = '${fparse E/3/(1-2*nu)}'\nG = '${fparse E/2/(1+nu)}'\n\nGc = 2.7 #need good values for this\nl = 0.02\n\noutput_name = 'tendon_fracture_predamaged_visco'\n\n[MultiApps]\n  [fracture]\n    type = TransientMultiApp\n    input_files = fracture_predamaged.i\n    cli_args = 'Gc=${Gc};l=${l}'\n    execute_on = 'TIMESTEP_END'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Transfers]\n  [from_d]\n    type = MultiAppCopyTransfer\n    from_multi_app = 'fracture'\n    variable = d\n    source_variable = d\n  []\n  [to_psie]\n    type = MultiAppCopyTransfer\n    to_multi_app = 'fracture'\n    variable = psie\n    source_variable = psie\n  []\n[]\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  displacements = 'disp_x disp_y'\n  #density = 1e4\n[]\n\n[Mesh]\n  [generated]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 2\n    nx = 40\n    ny = 20\n    xmax = 2\n    ymax = 1\n  []\n  construct_side_list_from_node_list = true\n  #uniform_refine = 1\n[]\n\n[Adaptivity]\n  marker = marker\n  initial_marker = marker\n  initial_steps = 1\n  stop_time = 0\n  max_h_level = 1\n  [Markers]\n    [marker]\n      type = BoxMarker\n      bottom_left = '0.7 0 0'\n      top_right = '1.3 1 0'\n      outside = DO_NOTHING\n      inside = REFINE\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [disp_x]\n  []\n  [disp_y]\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxVariables]\n  [fx]\n  []\n  [d]\n  []\n[]\n\n[ICs]\n  [IC_damage]\n    type = RndBoundingBoxIC\n    x1 = 0.95\n    x2 = 1.05\n    y1 = 0.3\n    y2 = 0.7\n    mx_invalue = 1.0\n    mn_invalue = 0.9\n    mx_outvalue = 0\n    mn_outvalue = 0\n    variable = d\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [SolidMechanics]\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y'\n    use_displaced_mesh = true\n    use_automatic_differentiation = true \n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [left_x]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_x\n    boundary = left\n    value = 0\n  []\n  [left_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_y\n    boundary = left\n    value = 0\n  []\n  [right_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_y\n    boundary = right\n    value = 0\n  []\n  [right_x]\n    type = FunctionNeumannBC\n    function = '5e5 * 0.1 * (1 + sin(2*pi*t*5))'\n    #type = FunctionDirichletBC\n    #function = '0.001 * (sin(2*pi*t*5))'\n    variable = disp_x\n    boundary = right\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [bulk]\n    type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'K G'\n    prop_values = '${K} ${G}'\n  []\n  [degradation]\n    type = PowerDegradationFunction\n    property_name = g\n    expression = (1-d)^p*(1-eta)+eta\n    phase_field = d\n    parameter_names = 'p eta'\n    parameter_values = '2 1e-6'\n  []\n  [./strain]\n    type = ADComputeFiniteStrain\n    displacements = 'disp_x disp_y'\n  [../]\n  [defgrad]\n    type = ComputeDeformationGradient\n  []\n  [elasticity]\n    type = HenckyIsotropicElasticity\n    bulk_modulus = K\n    shear_modulus = G\n    phase_field = d\n    degradation_function = g\n    output_properties = 'elastic_strain psie'\n    outputs = exodus\n  []\n  [viscoelasticity]\n    type = GeneralizedKelvinVoigtModel\n    creep_modulus = '10e9 10e9'\n    creep_viscosity = '1 10'\n    poisson_ratio = 0.3\n    young_modulus = 660e6\n  [../]\n  [stress]\n    type = ComputeLargeDeformationStress\n    elasticity_model = elasticity\n    viscoelasticity_model = viscoelasticity\n    output_properties = 'stress'\n    outputs = exodus\n  []\n[]\n\n[UserObjects]\n  [./update]\n    type = LinearViscoelasticityManager\n    viscoelastic_model = viscoelasticity\n    use_automatic_differentiation = true\n  [../]\n[]\n\n[Postprocessors]\n  [Fx]\n    type = NodalSum\n    variable = fx\n    boundary = right\n  []\n  [damage_max]\n    type = ElementExtremeValue\n    value_type = max\n    variable = d\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = NEWTON\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu'\n  end_time = 1\n  dt = 0.01\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  file_base = '${output_name}'\n  exodus = true\n  csv = true\n  print_linear_residuals = false\n[]",

          "bodyText": "Hey all,\nI'm running a pretty large mesh (generated via the Reactor module in MOOSE) doing a thermal solve w/ HeatConduction and deformation with IsotropicElasticityTensor, ComputeThermalExpansionEigenstrain, ComputeFiniteStrainElasticStress, and Physics/SolidMechanics/QuasiStatic. I'll provide an example of my use of each below.\nThe problem I'm running in to, is negative Jacobians specifically at certain TRI mesh blocks. The blocks where this happens are the TRIs in created from PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator, almost all occurring in bottom of the geometry (where the reflector is defined). I've seen this happen before where a mesh element is small and the expansion inverts the mesh, but that's not what's happening here. All the volumes in the error report are positive, nothing stands out when I visually inspect the mesh, I even increased the size of the TRI elements and still get the errors.\nHere's the geometry and the specific blocks that get the errors:\n\n\nAny ideas on what's causing this? Feel free to ask questions, I'm a bit in the dark of how to approach debugging this, so any help is very appreciated.\nEdit: Also of note, my first attempt to debug this was setting the thermal expansion coefficient for the entire reflector material to 0. This worked for a handful of non-linear iterations, but eventually failed.\nI'll attach my input and the error output so you can check it out. Apologies in advance for how large the input it, I generate it via a few scripts so it's not very human-readable.\ninput.txt\nproblems.txt\nThanks y'all.",

Previously, with the case where theta = 0, I had simply created two different blocks in the lower (black) rectangle with BoundingBoxNodeSetGenerator (even though both sides had the same material properties), and then I used SideSetsBetweenSubdomainsGenerator to define the surface.\nNow that I have an angle, is it still possible to do this, or would I need to try to do it directly from the mesh generation software? I was having issues with that in the past (refining specific subregions within the meshing software and still retaining domain names) hence why I did the subdomain definitions within MOOSE.",

it's expected result of the abaqus user-element implementation in moose or not. However, it seems like each processor called the plugin uel.f across all 27 elements, but we clearly see the correct parallel partition with 4 cpus.\nQuestion 1:\nFrom the above background about AbaqusUserElement, If I deleted the DynamicLibraryLoader function especially for uel.f Plugin, I wanna directly output the jelem=elem->id()+1 within UELThread.C w/o plugin function _uel():\n\n                  std::cout << \"Element number is           \" << jelem << \"\\n\";\n\n\nthe new wrong Output is not the same as the above old Output with plugin uel.f, I cannot understand this difference, how can I get the same Output without plugin ?\nnew wrong Output:\n\n                            Time Step 0, time = 0\n\n                            Time Step 1, time = 10, dt = 10\n                            Element number is:            1\n                            Element number is:           13\n                            Element number is:           14\n                            Element number is:           15\n                            Element number is:           17\n                            Element number is:            2\n                            Element number is:            3\n                            Element number is:           10\n\n\nThe new wrong Output only for one processor and also executed on EXEC_PRE_KERNELS.\n\n\n\nevidence 2:\nTry sub- UO class based on parent class ElementUserObject\n[which only output current element ID with _current_elem->id()+1],\nthe output on terminal as shown in below:\n\nmesh information [same]:\n\n                           Parallelism:\n                                    Num Processors:            4\n                                    Num Threads:               1\n                           Mesh:\n                                    Parallel Type:             replicated\n                                    Mesh Dimension:            3\n                                    Spatial Dimension:         3\n                           Nodes:\n                                    Total:                     64\n                                    Local:                     30\n                                    Min/Max/Avg:               6/30/16\n                           Elems:\n                                    Total:                     27\n                                    Local:                     8\n                                    Min/Max/Avg:               6/8/6\n                                    Num Subdomains:            1\n                                    Num Partitions:            4\n                                    Partitioner:               metis\n\n\n\nOutput [1. the execute_on EXEC_PRE_KERNELS]:\n\n                            Time Step 0, time = 0\n\n                            Time Step 1, time = 10, dt = 10\n                            Element number is:           10\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nthis output is totally incorrect. From my view, I just wanna output the individual ElementID of each element. This is to say, the threadJoin( ) and finalize( ) are not necessary for this expectation. In AbaqusUserElement UO, it did not use the the threadJoin( ) and finalize( ) as well.\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nFrom the two evidence 1, 2, The only AbaqusUserElement can output ElementID of all elements but duplicated.\nAlthough this ElementID example is simple, it's important to implement elemental value individually. Is there any way to focus on only each element ? by the way, I understood the UOs BlockAverageValue and HomogenizationConstraints, which calculated Elemental value from quadrature points loop, threadJoining into shared map container, and gatherSum to global value. However, it is different from the expectation of this discussion, I just wanna perform the quadrature points loop, calculate each Elemental value, and output it element by element. This idea maybe the same as Elemental value postprocessor for Paraview visualization.\nthe descent trend :\ndomain (FEProblem) (global)   --->  subProblems (processors)  --->  subDomains (blocks) (each processor)\nElements (block) (each processor)  --->  quadrature points (Element) (each processor)  --->\nquadrature point (each processor), is my understanding correct ?\nMaybe I can try output each ElementID within computeProperties() , the result could be correct ?\n\n\nThanks, if developers need any info., plz feel free let me know.\nbest regards,\ntianwen",

So in order to compile successfully I have to copy the .mod compiled externally into it, which I think is a very stupid way, so I would like to ask you for help.\nHere is the compilation script I wrote\uff0c SCAPN is  my external program.\n\nyours\nlvjiahui",
