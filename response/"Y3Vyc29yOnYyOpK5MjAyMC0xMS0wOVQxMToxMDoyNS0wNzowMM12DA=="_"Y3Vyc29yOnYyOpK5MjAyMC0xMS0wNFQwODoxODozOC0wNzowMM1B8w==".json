I would like to simulate a 2 phase flow of pure water with phase change and I am using a pressure-enthalpy formulation. My question is: how can I apply a temperature boundary condition? In other words, how to constrain enthalpy at a boundary such that, when the pressure changes, the temperature remains constant (or changes according to a specified value)?\nThank you for your help,\nFrancesco",

Some googling shows some hits for other FEM codes (I saw Elmer) and also a PETSc post. Most of these seem to be concerned with MUMPS, although apparently they submitted a fix for that.

You should always feel free to mention someone who you think is a good candidate for review. If you ping a MOOSE team member, that person will at a minimum make sure someone gets assigned to the job. I think @WilkAndy would also be a candidate to join the change-control-board which would give you the ability to assign.\nI'm also hopeful that in the not too distant future we as a MOOSE team have a more established/documented practice for rapidly assigning PRs.

Maybe I need to assign lieutenants and integrators. Even without the hierarchy, our project really could use a dedicated integrator resource. I feel like @loganharbour may be a good candidate for that role as he has the discipline and eye to stick with it. Maybe when he finishes up his PhD. I'm open to other suggestions though.

Already it is quite difficult to contribute to MOOSE modules, in my opinion, because we require tests and documentation (which is good and necessary, but burdensome), and the interfaces to MOOSE objects are becoming increasingly complex (again good, but burdensome), and so much has been written already (while writing a kernel for the diffusion equation is nice-and-easy in MOOSE, no one is doing that any more - i suspect many contributions are much more convoluted - mine certainly are).  Reviewing helps shift this burden from people like me, because you help me with aspects of C++, and you explain MOOSE interfaces and tell me that such-and-such has already been done in other areas of MOOSE, and you encourage new developers by helping with git/QA/etc teething issues.  Reviewing allows the MOOSE team to keep a birds-eye view on how the code is growing, allowing you to eliminate duplication, and to promote cross-fertilisation between different parts of the code, and it's good for the framework developers to understand what is needed by the modules.  So, reviewing is an important part of overall architecture and design, and should be done mostly by the core MOOSE team, in my opinion.\nEvery day or week i get asked to a review a paper, and mostly the papers are rubbish and my heart sinks at the thought.  Let's try to make MOOSE reviewing a more positive experience!",

This is the reason I pushed MOOSE to remove deprecation/legacy messages in applications caused by MOOSE changes. But that is not quite successful. If a large PR can be split into smaller PRs or well communicated with the reviewer in the design stage, the reviewing can be faster and not so costly. I think that this comes from a fact that high quality codes do not come free. MOOSE is trying to bring to a very high level SQ, which may not be needed by applications. One way is to move codes in modules as much as possible to your applications, then you can have less restrictive rules.",
