          "bodyText": "Dear all.\nI have some confusion about heat conduction and advection between blocks in MOOSE. I want to calculate a system with an inner heat source, which is a cylindrical structure, with an outer cylinder heating an inner cylinder. I set the initial temperature to 300K. Since I wanted to set both the upper and lower and outer boundary conditions as adiabatic, I didn't do anything in the BCs section. Since the outer block is releasing heat all the time, there shouldn't be a region where the temperature falls below 300K in the whole system, but it turns out that's not the case:\n\nI would like to know where I am setting it wrong, is it possible that there is something wrong with my mesh?\nIn addition, I also want to ask, if I set the inner cylinder to have water flowing (this is a fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer problem), what conditions do I need to set on the interface? Does heat conduction between solids require no conditions at the interface?\nHere are input file and mesh file.\nfile.zip",

If the solid has two faces that fit together (no gap between the two faces), what conditions do I need to set? If the fluid transfers heat in the pipeline, the fluid and the solid share an interface. Do I need to set the InterfaceKernel on the interface? If it is a fluid and solid interface with two faces that fit together (no gap between the two faces), do I have to set the InterfaceKernel on the interface?",

Which is outer bottom between the inner and outer cylinders?\nFinally if the block restriction of the diffusion kernel includes both regions, and they are in contact in the mesh, you do not need to set a special interface condition not let heat flux though.\nGuillaume",

For example, INSTemperatureTimeDerivative corresponds to \u03c1cp\u2202T/\u2202t, so I think adding it to Kernels can add a time term to the equation being solved. Is there any difference between HeatConductionTimeDerivative and INSTemperatureTimeDerivative (they both stand for \u03c1cp\u2202T/\u2202t)? Or is there any difference between INSADHeatConductionTimeDerivative and ADHeatConductionTimeDerivative (they both also stand for \u03c1cp\u2202T/\u2202t but use automatic differentiation)?\nI think a similar problem occurs when I crank up the density, the root of the problem is where there is a drop in temperature in a system that is constantly gaining heat with the same initial temperature.\nOuter_bottom represents the bottom of the outer cylinder, and there is an interface between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder (but I didn't give it a name because I'm not very good at using MOOSE mesh generators). The upper, lower, and surrounding boundary conditions are adiabatic, meaning that no heat is dissipated.\nThanks a lot.",

The boundary condition I used is that the temperature of outer_bottom is 600K.  As a result, there are two problems, one is that the temperature rises and falls abnormally at the interface, and the other is that it seems that the heat of the heat source is not introduced into the inner cylinder.  I would also like to ask, are there any examples of 3D transient heat conduction and convection heat transfer in MOOSE? I think maybe my input file is written wrong somewhere (though I can't find the error so far and have rewritten it many times).

I tried to use ViewFactorRayStudy to calculate, but I found that the angle coefficient obtained is like this:\n\nMoose recognized my solid model as a cavity, so there are only angular coefficients at ce1 and ce2. But my model is solid and the rays should be emitted outwards instead of inwards, I don't know if you have any suggestions to solve this problem.",

          "bodyText": "I have built a model that reproduces a doublet system where cold CO2 is injected into an aquifer from a first wellbore, and simultaneously fluid is produced at another wellbore. When the CO2 plume reaches the production wellbore, the produced fluid is a mixture of water and CO2.\nThe initial temperature is 90 \u00b0C and CO2 is injected at 60 \u00b0C. I am employing the PorousFlow2PhasePS material in non-isothermal conditions. Both injection and production are represented with PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole sinks/sources. The initial pressure is 27 MPa, CO2 is injected at 37 MPa while the fluid is produced at 24 MPa. The reservoir is 100 m thick and gravity is neglected.\nI have observed that the pressure at the injection point is decreasing with time: why is this occurring and why is the pressure not constant and identical to the value specified in the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole command? I am having a hard time understanding the reason behind this.\nTo inject CO2, I am assigning \"sgas\" as the variable in the injection PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole. If I change it to water injection \"pwater\", then the pressure is kept constant and at 37 MPa as specified by the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole. I suspect it has to do with the relative permeability, which is likely influencing the mobility term in the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole model, but I do not understand why P_wellbore is changing.\nI have attached the files of the simulation, along with a graph showing the evolution of CO2 and water pressure and CO2 saturation at the injection well.\nAny suggestion is highly appreciated!\n\nCO2-Injection.tar.gz",

This is by design.  Here is an explanation....  The Peaceman formulation works by using the analytical solution of the fluid pressure in an element: some further remarks are at https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/sinks.html .  More specifically, if your bottomhole pressure is P within an element (you specify P in the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole), then MOOSE's finite-element solution at the nodes of that element will generally not be P.  Your postprocessor(s) will be equal (or related) to MOOSE's solution directly, not directly to your bottomhole pressure.  The discrepancy you see will be problem dependent.  For example, if the finite element containing your Peaceman borehole is huge, then the porepressure at its nodes will be quite different from bottomhole pressure, while if your finite element is small, the element's nodal pressures will be similar to the bottomhole pressure.  As the finite element size limits to the size of the borehole, the nodal pressures limit to the bottomhole pressure.\nthe reason why the pressure is changing could be the mobility, since physically it's likely to be getting easier and easier to pump in CO2 (a CO2-saturated reservoir usually has higher mobility).  However, i also suspect that it's a temperature effect.  As you cool the reservoir, the fluids will contract and the pressure will decrease - sometimes quite significantly.  i suggest running a simulation at 90degC and exploring the difference.\nNow a question from me: on your figure, why does Pwater = PCO2 when gas saturation = 1.  Usually capillarity would mean Pwater << PCO2 at that saturation.\na",

Below are some comments on your points:\n\nI understand a bit better the principles of the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole, especially this element-size dependency. I have run a model with smaller elements and I saw that the pressure is decreasing earlier than compared with larger elements;\nThanks for the hint, I have tried an isothermal case and the changes in pressure compared to cold injection are very small (but non exactly 0, see the plot). Concerning mobility, I have tried a case with constant relative permeability but it does not converge. Perhaps it is because of null capillary force (my guess is that constant pc and rel_perm make it difficult for the PS formulation to calculate sgas);\nCapillarity is null because I fixed capillary pressure pc=0 on purpose, I wanted to isolate the effects for now. But your hint is correct, I have tried with the capillary pressure and the results show that indeed higher retention properties (VanGenuchten with alpha=8e-7 and m=0.6) keep the gas pressure closer to the prescribed values from the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole. One question: is there a way to make the retention properties temperature-dependent? For example, through temperature-dependent surface tension?\nI have another question on the usage of PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole in a true 2D setting. I have run an example of that but I do not fully understand what would be the meaning of the out-of-plane size of the wellbore? A 2D model is usually assumed as unit thickness in the out-of-plane direction, so what would be for example a PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole with 2 points, one of which with a z coordinate (assuming 2D is in x,y) is 100 m? I have run some tests and observed that the injected mass flow rate reaches an asymptotic limit with the increasing out-of-plane size of the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole. I have tried different sizes from 1m to 3000m and found that at approximately 500m out-of-plane well length, the mass flow rate was 99.2% the one of 3000m wellbore size. I am not sure about its physical interpretation, or if it is even correct to use PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole in a 2D case.\n\nThe figure below shows the results of the different trials. The light grey plots indicate the base case, for comparison.",

It would fit into the PorousFlow framework well, but we just haven't coded such a thing.  Do you have experimental data for that, by the way?\nregarding the out-of-plane question: yes, you can use the Peaceman in that situation, and usually the out-of-plane length is assumed to be 1m (or, equivalently, everything is calculated per unit thickness), both in the conceptual model, and in the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole.  (You may assume otherwise if you like, but it's unusual).  Often people supply just one point to the PeacemanBorehole (with the \"z\" direction = zero, for instance) along with line_length=1 and line_direction='0 0 1'.\nI'm not sure whether the following suits your problem or not....   You might like to consider another boundary condition for the borehole injection.  For instance, if you're fixing the injection rate, or your injection regime is a known function of porepressure in the rock, then PorousFlowPolyLineSink might be better.  Or, if you're fixing the porepressure, then a DirichletBC might be OK (but remember a DirichletBC is fixing porepressure by injecting/removing a fluid, so you have to be careful which fluid component (Variable) you're applying the DirichletBC to).\n\na",

One simplistic approach is to scale entry pressure $p_a$ with surface tension $s$ as\n$$p_a = p_{a0} \\frac{s}{s_0}$$\nwhere surface tension $s_0$ and entry pressure $p_{a0}$ are measured at reference conditions. Then, one could assume the variations as a function of temperature and pressure through $s(p, T)$, assuming experimental results (often in the form of MD simulations) for the latter are available as in, e.g., Nielsen et al. (2012). For higher temperature applications, there was an interesting work at the last EGU by Shiga et al. (2022), but I believe the journal paper is not out yet. In any case, it is definetely a relevant and underexplored topic.\n\n\nThank you for the suggestion on how to use the PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole in a 2D setting.\n\n\nI thought about using DirichletBC and fixing pressure, but I am not sure how to compute the extracted/injected masses at a node from the PorousFlowDarcyVelocityComponent module in AuxKernels.

One ugly way that you could calculate mass flowrates through a \"Dirichlet borehole\" is to construct a sideset around the borehole, then use a PorousFlowOutflowBC with a save_in to record the mass-flow through each node on that sideset (and example of save_in is found in test/tests/sinks/injection_production_eg_outflowBC.i). Then use another almost-identical PorousFlowOutflowBC, but with multiplier = -1.  The result is that the residual gets a contribution of +flow-flow (=0) so it is unaffected, but you record the flow in the save_in AuxVariable.  This is quite ugly!\na",

                          "bodyText": "@fparisio , you got the concept correct, yet.  There are some caveats:\n\nthe PorousFlowOutflowBCs need to be applied to a boundary that contains element edges, not just a single node.  So you should create a boundary in your mesh that surrounds the injection node.  The normal to the boundary should be oriented \"outward\" (if you get this wrong then you'll just record a negative co2_kg_per_s, which is no big deal).\nthe variable and mass_fraction_component must be set correctly.  i can't tell from the above snippet whether you've done this correctly, but you probably have.  If the sgas variable is looking after fluid_component = 1 in the Kernels, and the mass-fraction of fluid_component = 1 is all in phase = 1, and the mass-fraction of fluid_component = 0 is all in phase = 0 then you're currently recording phase 1 (probably gas), fluid_component 1 (probably CO2) coming through the boundary.\n\nI'm not so sure of your DirichletBCs.  You need to look at your Kernels to see which fluid_component each variable (sgas and pwater) are looking after.  Also, your PorousFlowMassFraction Materials to see which phase those fluid components correspond to.  The important thing is to physically interpret the DirichletBCs as injecting/removing fluid components in order to satisfy the DirichletBC.  For instance, at the moment the injection_dirichlet_saturation might be fixing sgas = 1 by injecting fluid_component = 1 into the system (which is probably in CO2, and is probably in phase 1, which is probably gas), and the  injection_dirichlet_pressure might be fixing pwater = 37e6 by injecting fluid_component = 0 into the system (which is probably H2O, and is probably in phase 0, which is probably liquid).
