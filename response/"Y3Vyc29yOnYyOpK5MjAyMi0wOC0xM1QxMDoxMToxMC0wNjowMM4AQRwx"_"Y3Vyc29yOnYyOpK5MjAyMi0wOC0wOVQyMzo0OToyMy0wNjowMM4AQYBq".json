The main app (A) and subapp (B) both have manual periodic BC with translation vectors along x, y, z.\nI create the sidesets for left, right, etc, and use clone_parent_mesh = true.\nThe periodic BC on main app A runs without issues, while the one in subapp B results in periodic boundary neighbor not found error. when the BC in subapp B is commented out, it starts up normally.\nI also tried running subapp B and C without A, and it seems to be working without removing the periodic BC.\nis there a specific reason or fix for this?\nBest,\nKhaled",

To do this, I have been attempting to use the strain on the upper and lower integration points, however this is not giving me the correct result. I believe I have tracked down the issue to a detail mentioned in a comment on an example file:\n# The stress_yy for the four elements at z = -0.57735 * (t/2) (first qp below mid-surface of shell) are:\n# 3031.089 Pa, 2165.064 Pa, 1299.038 Pa and 433.0127 Pa. \n\nIn file Beam_Bending_Moment_AD.i\nThis comment, and the way the stress is extracted by the auxkernel, indicates that in the second order case, the lower integration point is not located at -1/2 thickness, but instead -0.57735*1/2thickness. My question(s):\n\nwhy is this the location of the integration point?\nWhere will the integration point be located in different through thickness orders with different numbers of integration points? For example, with fourth order through thickness there is one point below the midplane, one at the midplane and one above the midplane, but where are the above and below ones located?\nIf these values aren't known/communicated to users then it is impossible to know what the stress outputs given by the elements mean. If you take stress values at 0.57735*0.5 of your thickness without realising instead of the top of the shell, they will be artificially lowered.",

Between these points is variation linear or does the interpolation between them change depending on the order (I'm guessing the second).

The data type of the variables also changed from \"const VariableValue & _u;\" to \"const ArrayVariableValue & _u;\". There are severe questions about data types that I would like to ask.\n\n\nHow do I express the component of _u in the code, which brackets should I use, [] or ()?\n\n\nI need to use the value of _u in another file, so assign the value of _u in the kernel file to another file by means of a pointer. My current compilation succeeds in writing the assignment  in the kernel file\n\n\nfor (size_t i=0; i<_count; ++i)\n  _cfd_data._u[i] = _u[i];\n\nDeclare the new variable in another file\nRealEigenVector _u[10];\nI don't know if this makes sense, is there any connection between the data types RealEigenVector and ArrayVariableValue?\n\n\nI found the data type RealEigenMatrix in MooseType.h. If I replace the Real type in the code when I have a single variable with the RealEigenVector type which is suitable for multiple variables, should I replace RealVectorValue with RealEigenMatrix, and how should a variable of type RealEigenMatrix represent its components?\n\n\nFor the previous RealTensorValue type, I did not find a matching type suitable for multiple variables. Is there any data type that can represent a variable with more than 2 dimensions? For example, I want to represent a variable with a dimension of 5 x 5 x 3 x 3, which can be seen as a large matrix nested within a small matrix, where each component of the large 5 x 5 matrix is a small 3 x 3 matrix, what data type is suitable for such a variable?\n\n\nI also found the data types RealVectorArrayValue and RealTensorArrayValue in MooseType.h. They both seem to have a limit on the number of columns, with a dynamic number of rows and a Moose::dim number of columns. Can the number of columns for these two data types exceed 3?\n\n\nCan any variable in the code directly represent the order of _u of a multivariate? Which self-contained function in moose can be used to get the norm directly for variables of type RealEigenVector?",

Could it be that you happen to choose a combination of parameters that aren't stable?\nAnd regardless of all these, my suggestion remains the same: you need to first follow the setup in the regression tests, and remove the bdf2 scheme unless you have a clear motivation for that change, in which case you'll need to explain to us why would you want to do that.",
