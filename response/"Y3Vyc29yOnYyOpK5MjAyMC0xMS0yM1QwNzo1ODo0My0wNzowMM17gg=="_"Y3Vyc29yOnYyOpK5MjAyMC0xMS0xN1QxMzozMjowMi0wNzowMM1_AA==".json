Maybe problem is elsewhere.\nThank you in advance.",

However, when you set T to be an AuxVariable, you are telling MOOSE that you want to control the dynamics of T using the FunctionAux.\nYou've got to decide which one you want to do.   Is T a dynamical variable, or are you setting T externally using your FunctionAux?\nPerhaps what you're trying to do is set an initial condition for T, and then solve for its evolution?  If so, use a FunctionIC.",

Actually, I want to set this temperature field (hot center and cold boundary) as the boundary conditions.\nfor example, if I set the left boundary temperature is 600 K and the right boundary temperature is 700 K. There is a temperature gradient in the domain. Then I couple the heat conduction equation to research the effect of void or bubble on the temperature gradient due to its different thermal conductivity.\nBut I found I just can set the top, bottom, left, and right for the boundary. So I don't know how to create this temperature field (hot center and cold boundary) using these boundaries. If I use FuntionIC setting this temperature field as the initial condition, I found the temperature will quickly change to a constant for the whole system.\nSo, what I want to do is create a stable temperature field (hot center and cold boundary) like boundary condition. And couple the heat conduction equation to research the effect of void or bubble on the temperature gradient. Do you know how to do this?\nBest,\nPeng",
