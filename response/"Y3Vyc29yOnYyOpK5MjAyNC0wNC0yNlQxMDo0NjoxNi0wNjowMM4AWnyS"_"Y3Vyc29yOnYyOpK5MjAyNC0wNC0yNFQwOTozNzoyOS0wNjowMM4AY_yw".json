But since I know, in HPC it's good to install it with no environments to use already modules like GCC, MPI, right? Also, HPC install guides don't mention to install conda MOOSE environment.\nHow can I fix it and continue with the installation?\nThank you in advance",

Also, many HPC clusters will configure their cluster to prevent processes from using any resources in parallel unless the process is launched using srun. The TestHarness doesn't know that it needs to do this, and thus you see failures for some tests.\nThe TestHarness, for all intent and purposes is a job scheduler. It walks through all the tests it is being asked to perform, and figures out how to properly manage the amount of cores you are allowing to be using at any given time (like 6 cores. e.g. -j 6). The problem is, when the TestHarness encounters a test requiring multiple cores, it will launch this test using mpiexec -n . This is where a test running on SLURM clusters will fail. As this is not the proper way to execute a binary to be run in parallel (SLURM requires that binaries be scheduled to run using srun).\nBut it is very problematic for a job scheduler (which the TestHarness is) to use another job scheduler (which SLURM is).\nThat's the long of it.\nHowever the error you are receiving, about JIT Compilation... we might be able to solve. Can you explain how it is you ran that one test? Did you manually execute your binary (or moose_test-opt)? Can you print out all the commands you ran leading up to the failure? This will help me understand what to ask you next...",

          "bodyText": "Dear Community,\nFollowing the procedure recommended here, I would like to propose the property \"add_subdomain_names\" for the object \"MooseMesh\" for discussion.\nMotivation and current situation\nUsing the property add_subdomain_ids of the MooseMesh base class a user can add (initially empty) subdomains to an existing mesh for later usage. Up to my knowledge today only subdomain IDs can be added and no name is provided for these subdomains. To ease reading and debugging of the Moose input file it would be great to also provide the possibility to add subdomain names. For this purpose I like to propose an additional property for the object \"MooseMesh\": add_subdomain_names\nProposed property \"add_subdomain_names\" for the object MooseMesh\nFollowing the design pattern of existing objects and their properties, e.g. with \"symbol_names\" and \"symbol_values\" in ParsedFunction I like to add the property add_subdomain_names as a companion property to the existing property add_subdomain_ids. While add_subdomain_ids is taking a vector of subdomain ids, the additional (optional) add_subdomain_names provides the corresponding vector of SubdomainNames. The property add_subdomain_names would only be valid, if add_subdomain_ids is defined.\nA input file using this property might look like:\n[Mesh]\n  ...\n  add_subdomain_ids  =  '5      6      7'\n  add_subdomain_names = 'BlockX BlockY BlockZ'\n  ...\n[]\n\nImpact to existing Moose apps\nAs this proposal only adds functionality. Existing Moose apps should be able to cope with the proposed changes without any problems.\nPlease find a crude proof of concept here and there.\nIf this proposal meets with interest, I need support in preparing the code before I can create a PR. The proof-of-concept works for me, but does not include support for \"parallel mesh\", for example.\nI would be delighted if you could consider this proposal.",

You can specify multiple values in the \"length\" and \"n_elems\" parameters for each of your subsections. Please try that to see if you still get the jump. Nothing in your input file suggests there should be a jump there (physically there should be no loss there). If you still get the jump, that suggests it related to the transition of the element sizes, not the presence of the junction component. In that case, I suspect the slope reconstruction to be at fault. Try setting \"rdg_slope_reconstruction = none\" and see if the jump persists. These aren't solutions, just troubleshooting.",
