I have two questions about applying the module and am grateful for any input or suggestion:\n\n\nThe example is on the developing stage, but I faced the issue with being able to run the simulations with the version  of geochemistry module of 30.04 and  not being able to run it with the version of 30.07.\n\n\nWhile running the simulations, I receive negative concentrations on the first time steps which obviously should not happen.\n\n\nWould you have any idea what could be the reason for both of these issues?\nI am providing below the geochemistry input file:\n\nchem_THC1D.txt\nThanks a lot and a great day,\nElena",

However, I am trying to stop the growth at the spikes by manipulating the phase-field variable mu (grand potential PFM). I am using DiscreteNucleation material property to increase the magnitude of mu at the interface of the spike so that the growth takes place only at the flat area rather than the spike. This should result in a overall much smoother/flatter profile.\nHowever, I am not able to achieve this using DiscreteNucleation material property which is trying to force mu to -20. A high (-ve) value of mu should result in lower concentration at the peak causing lower growth rate at spike as compared to the flatter region.\nThanks\n@dschwen @laagesen @GiudGiud",

This is a pretty complicated physical problem. Off the top of my head it seems that you would need to add a coupled electric field and solve Poisson's equation to understand the effect of additive concentration on electric field, and then the resulting field would be what is responsible for pushing the metal ions away. I'd suggest to do some literature search to find an existing phase-field model for this problem and we can try to help you implement that once you find it.",
