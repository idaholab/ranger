I am a little confused about that.\nThe problem definition was like this: A species transported from the left to right. It was driven by the velocity. I had a left and right boundary condition given the amount of the species and would like to know the amount distribution along the domain. The geometry was 5 cm with 10 elements.\nI could compile my application and get the result. The question was, there was a distribution inside a single element. But I thought it should be a unifrom distribution inside a single element and the changes should only located between elements since each element should be regared as a \"unit\" one.\nI am trying to find out a explanation on this. MOOSE is computing the kernel at quadrature points. But I think this is not going to cause any difference inside the element.\nAny help are appreciated.\nYang",

This is a little different than the other perm formulations, which assume that permeability depends on volumetric strain.  When creating PorousFlow initially, we considered the idea of allowing Material properties to be functions of arbitrary derivatives of variables, but rejected the idea as being too costly, both in memory and compute (almost every model would repeatedly just compute a bunch of zeroes for the derivatives).\nThis is possibly the most obscure and complicated part of PorousFlow, sorry, because the derivatives are a bit mind-bending\nYou do not need to calculate the derivatives for PorousFlow to work.  If you don't, they will be assumed to be zero and you will get an inexact Jacobian and poorer convergence, BUT maybe that doesn't really matter in your case.\nIf you look at \n  \n    \n      moose/modules/porous_flow/include/materials/PorousFlowVolumetricStrain.h\n    \n    \n        Lines 57 to 62\n      in\n      ecb6d9c\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n             /** \n        \n\n        \n          \n              * The derivative of the total volumetric strain with respect to the porous flow variables. \n        \n\n        \n          \n              * Since the total volumetric strain depends on derivatives of the displacement variables, \n        \n\n        \n          \n              * this should be multiplied by _grad_phi in kernels \n        \n\n        \n          \n              */ \n        \n\n        \n          \n             MaterialProperty<std::vector<RealGradient>> & _dvol_total_strain_qp_dvar; \n        \n    \n  \n\n  and \n  \n    \n      moose/modules/porous_flow/src/materials/PorousFlowVolumetricStrain.C\n    \n    \n        Lines 47 to 48\n      in\n      ecb6d9c\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           _dvol_total_strain_qp_dvar( \n        \n\n        \n          \n               declareProperty<std::vector<RealGradient>>(\"dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar\")) \n        \n    \n  \n\n  and the code for calculating this object \n  \n    \n      moose/modules/porous_flow/src/materials/PorousFlowVolumetricStrain.C\n    \n    \n        Lines 71 to 79\n      in\n      ecb6d9c\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           _dvol_total_strain_qp_dvar[_qp].resize(_num_var, RealGradient()); \n        \n\n        \n          \n           for (unsigned i = 0; i < _ndisp; ++i) \n        \n\n        \n          \n             if (_dictator.isPorousFlowVariable(_disp_var_num[i])) \n        \n\n        \n          \n             { \n        \n\n        \n          \n               // the i_th displacement is a PorousFlow variable \n        \n\n        \n          \n               const unsigned int pvar = _dictator.porousFlowVariableNum(_disp_var_num[i]); \n        \n\n        \n          \n               _dvol_strain_rate_qp_dvar[_qp][pvar](i) = 1.0 / _dt; \n        \n\n        \n          \n               _dvol_total_strain_qp_dvar[_qp][pvar](i) = 1.0; \n        \n\n        \n          \n             } \n        \n    \n  \n\n  you'll see that the Material Property called dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar , is \"d(volumetric strain) / d(displacement)\".   I write this in quotes because it's not strictly notationally correct (and that's why the object is a std::vector<RealGradient> not just a Real)   To understand further, and understand why this dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar is needed, imagine a Kernel that is exactly residual = volumetric_strain.  Then, a Jacobian entry is d(residual) / d(displacement_j) = 1 * grad_j (shape function) .   If you don't understand this, please ask, as this is the key point.   The \"1\" in the previous formula is a real number (1) and is exactly a component of dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar.  More generally, imagine a Kernel that is residual = f(volumetric_strain).  Then, a Jacobian entry is d(residual) / d(displacement_j) = sum_over_i f'(volumetric_strain) * dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar(j, i) grad_i (shape function).   In MOOSE language, the \"j\" is the std::vector part, and the \"i\" is the RealGradient, and grad_i (shape function) is grad_phi.\nProbably the above will explain why there is no _dvol_strain_qp_dgradvar.  The Material called dPorousFlow_total_volumetric_strain_qp_dvar` is closest to what you want.\nIf you look at \n  \n    \n      moose/modules/porous_flow/include/materials/PorousFlowPermeabilityBase.h\n    \n    \n        Lines 28 to 32\n      in\n      ecb6d9c\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           /// d(quadpoint permeability)/d(PorousFlow variable) \n        \n\n        \n          \n           MaterialProperty<std::vector<RealTensorValue>> & _dpermeability_qp_dvar; \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n        \n\n        \n          \n           /// d(quadpoint permeability)/d(grad(PorousFlow variable)) \n        \n\n        \n          \n           MaterialProperty<std::vector<std::vector<RealTensorValue>>> & _dpermeability_qp_dgradvar; \n        \n    \n  \n\n you'll see the definition d(perm)/d(var) and d(perm)/d(gradvar).  Consider the case that kernel = perm, so Jacobian = d(perm)/d(var) * phi + d(perm)/d(gradvar) * grad_phi.  Hopefully this makes sense: the key is, we need derivatives of Materials with respect to variables, and the gradients of variables, because we need to know whether the Jacobian entries should be multiplied by phi or grad_phi.",

It will not work in the future. So save yourself the headache, and separate these environments now.",
