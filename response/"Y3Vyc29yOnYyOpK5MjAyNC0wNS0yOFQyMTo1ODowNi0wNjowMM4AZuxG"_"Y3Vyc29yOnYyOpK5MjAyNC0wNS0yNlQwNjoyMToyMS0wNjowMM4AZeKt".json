As my problem involves contact heat transfer so it needs coupling Solid Mechanics module to acquire contact pressure. Directly I chose motar way, but it gave me the error\nThe requested mortar interface AutomaticMortarGeneration object does not yet exist!\nI put my input and mesh there. https://github.com/jin0123456/didactic-pancake\nI wonder if it's my mesh problem. In motar way is there a requirement that the lengths of the two sides match? As my sides don't match.\nMuch appreciated for advice.",

                  "bodyText": "Your setup looks to have the thermal contact model test_thm.i as the Master app with the mechanical contact calculation (test_mech.i) as the subapp. Here, you are passing the interface_normal_lm through a transfer from the sub to master app. I've not seen this type of setup before for coupled mechanical and thermal contact. Is there any reason you do not have both mechanical and thermal contact in the same input file as is done in the test moose/modules/combined/test/tests/gap_heat_transfer_mortar/finite-2d/varied_pressure_thermomechanical_mortar.i? Have you verified that your simulation runs when it all in one input? If so, then I suspect it is related the mesh creation or the multiapp transfers. I cannot run your inputs as there are several non-MOOSE objects. If you have a MOOSE only example that generates the same error using your multiapp setup, it would be easier to debug.\nFor the meshing, you create the lower D mesh blocks manually in the master app, but in the sub app they are created automatically by the mechanical contact [Contact] block. Are these blocks consistent? It may be that the master app is requesting the interface_normal_lm which has not yet been created in the sub app yet. To answer your question about differing lengths of the sidesets in contact, it is fine to have sides of different lengths. I recommend making the primary surface the longer surface in your 2D-RZ setup.",

In moose, the variable parameter in the kernel definition will determine where the residual entries go in the nonlinear system. You see by (just doing R=matrix*sol-rhs for example) that the residual from $B^T u$ will actually go to the parts of the residual vector which are associated with the pressure degrees of freedom. This is actually the reason why it is hard to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, you have a 0 pressure diagonal and you are forced to solve it by using either a segregated approach or a Schurr-complement-based approach.",

I spent around two months trying to figure out how to implement it in MOOSE.\nCouple of places where I was not able to figure out how to solve the problem are\n\nThe eigenvalue problem is used for diffusion equation while the problem is a vector valued function with plane strain assumption for 2D. I wasn't sure if the tensor mechanics module was coupled with the eigenvalue problem.\nImplementation using this methodology required me to modify the global mass and stiffness matrix by multiplying it with constraint matrix. I couldn't find a way to access the global matrices. Even in the MOOSE code the element matrices were added to the appropriate entries in the global matrices.\nThe mesh is duplicated for taking the real and imaginary parts. I tried to mimic this by considering four dofs in one node but the assembly for this case is different from the normal fe assembly because of the imaginary components.\nThe global mass and stiffness matrix needs to be constructed only once. Only the constraint matrix depends on the wave number which is varied to get the reduced matrices and get eigenvalues.",

Specifically, I want to evaluate how variations in the material properties affect the outcomes. To achieve this, I plan to use the norm of the gradient of the material property across the simulation space as a proxy measure.\nMathematically, I am considering the expression:\n\u2225\u2207E\u22252\nwhere E represents the Young's modulus, which is assigned to the elements and stored in an auxiliary variable (AuxVar). The goal is to compute this gradient norm within my simulation to analyze the effect of spatial variations in Young's modulus.\nCould anyone suggest the easiest way to compute this within my simulation?\nThanks in advance,\nJose",

The on-the-fly functor system does allow nodal evaluations, but it requires the user to specify a subdomain ID. This is to eliminate ambiguity about how to evaluate potentially discontinuous properties at subdomain interfaces.\n\nHowever, in MOOSE's continuous finite element calculations, each face is executed only once, even though internal faces are shared by two elements. Once a face has been executed in one element, it will not be executed in the neighboring element. If a face is on the interface between different subdomains, wouldn't it only use the material data from one subdomain for its calculations?\ntemplate <typename RangeType>\nbool\nThreadedElementLoopBase<RangeType>::shouldComputeInternalSide(const Elem & elem,\n                                                              const Elem & neighbor) const\n{\n  auto level = [this](const auto & elem_arg)\n  {\n    if (_mesh.doingPRefinement())\n      return elem_arg.p_level();\n    else\n      return elem_arg.level();\n  };\n  const auto elem_id = elem.id(), neighbor_id = neighbor.id();\n  const auto elem_level = level(elem), neighbor_level = level(neighbor);\n\n  // When looping over elements and then sides, we need to make sure that we do not duplicate\n  // effort, e.g. if a face is shared by element 1 and element 2, then we do not want to do compute\n  // work both when we are visiting element 1 *and* then later when visiting element 2. Our rule is\n  // to only compute when we are visiting the element that has the lower element id when element and\n  // neighbor are of the same adaptivity level, and then if they are not of the same level, then\n  // we only compute when we are visiting the finer element\n  return (neighbor.active() && (neighbor_level == elem_level) && (elem_id < neighbor_id)) ||\n         (neighbor_level < elem_level);\n}\n\nThis seems unreasonable. I'm curious how MOOSE handles this situation. Does anyone have insights? Thank you for your attention.",

However, there are shared Nodes between different elements of the CFEM mesh, so when accelerating the transport fluxes based on the results of the coarse mesh, there is a question of which Elem the Node should be based on to do the scaling of its fluxes? For example, a Node may be shared by four Elems, and their scaling ratios are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, how should the flux scaling ratio of this Node be determined?\nThank you for your attention.
