In my formulation it is easier for me to describe the change in volume due to a volumetric mass source term i.e.\n$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\left(\\rho v_i\\right)_{,i} = c$\nwhere $c$ is the volumetric mass source term. Because for my problem the mass change through the boundary is defined on the surface as an IntegratedBC and I don't have any way to make this conversion directly, I would like to introduce a variable that represents a volumetric mass change for the elements on the boundary that results in the same mass change as the surface integral i.e.\n$\\int_{\\mathcal{B}} c dv = \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{B}} c^s da $\nwhere $c^s$ is the mass flow into the body across the surface. I think the answer I would expect would be for the $c$ term to be zero at all of the nodes except for on the surface that is seeing mass deposition or removal.\nIs what I want to do sensible or is there a better approach? Is there a way to restrict a volumetric kernel to only contribute to the residuals on the surface of the body?",

          "bodyText": "Hello Everyone,\nI am trying to get the strain energy density by using elastic tensor (not using stress and strain) with the following equation\n_strain_energy_density = (\u00bd) * ((_mechanical_strain) : (_elasticity_tensor) : (_mechanica_strain))\ni.e.\n\nFor this, first of all,  I made the double contraction using member function \"contractionIj\" of RankFourTensor _elasticity_tensor with the RankTwoTensor _mechanical_strain to get _stresss as follows\n\nAnd then I computed the _strain_energy_density using double contraction using member function \"doubleContraction\" of _stresss and _mechanical_strain following the equation given below\n\nFor this, my source code snippet is as follows:\n\nWith this snippet in the the src code the app compiled well. But on running simulation, produce the RankTwoTensor of _stresss with all element zero as printed below\n\nHowever, the printed non zero _elasticity_tensor (isotropic linear elastic tensor) and _mechanical_strain are as follows:\n\n\nHere, no input parameters (_elasticity_tensor and _mechanical_strain)  are zero producing zero _stresss.\nSo, It is suspected to have error in the use \"contractionIj\" member function in the following src code snippet\n\nCould anyone please help me out whether this is the correct way of using \"contractionIj\" member function??\nNote: You can find the reference for the \"contractionIj\" member function defined for RankFourTensor here [https://mooseframework.inl.gov/docs/doxygen/moose/classRankFourTensorTempl.html#a2b47567b94f148cc5b30bbb3739e80f1]\nFurther, files needed to check the module are available here:\n[https://github.com/bbist196/bright_star]\nYour help will be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\nThankyou",
