          "bodyText": "Dear all,\nI am running a multiapp problem with my sub-app considered a submodel of the main model. The 'submodel' effectively is a cut out of the main model sharing the same spatial coordinates. It essentially acts as an RVE enforcing the strain periodicity conditions in the model. Eventually I am interested in coupling these two models together at each load step and thinking to update the deformation of the main model based on the micro-beheviour of the submodel. Just for the case of proper creation of the submodel I had to use ABAQUS for modelling the FE. However the submodel runs an empty simulation with ABAQUS input file and i am getting the following lines.\n\nsub0: Time Step 1, time = 0.01, dt = 0.01\nsub0:  0 Nonlinear |R| = 0.000000e+00\nsub0:  Solve Converged!\n\nI need to make couple of adjustments in the input file when i am using an ABAQUS mesh. The 'auto_direction' command in periodic BC is unusable and so i manually defined and matched the periodic boundaries. A nodeset consisting of a single node (node closest to centroid) created to model the reference point needed for constraining the model. The attached files could used as a reference to diagnose the problem. Any advise on fixing the problem would be highly appreciated.\n04012022.zip",

So if you modify the expression for effective trial stress, you also need to modify the discrete update. Your expression is equivalent to having a flow direction as a function of the spectrum of the stress, from which the discrete update should follow. There might be something tricky to implement though, because your flow direction isn't constant during the plasticity update.",

OK, next suggestion - You did a make clobberall, but I would also recommend trying a clean using git as well. You need to commit any outstanding changes you have that you might want to keep - this will clear all of that out. Perform the command git clean -xfd in your moose directory, and then start a fresh Terminal window (to make sure your environment is clean as well). Then activate your moose environment and try again.",

          "author": {
            "login": "garciapintado"
          },
          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI am struggling to get convergence in a thermo-hydraulic model with PorousFlow. In my real case scenario, the model domain is a 2D cross-section of an ocean-basin, bounded at both sides by continental margins. The model aims to simulate basin-wide hydrothermal circulation. This is a density-driven circulation, where the thermal energy that heats the water comes form the underlying mantle. Thanks to you (discussion #20139, solved by @WilkAndy ) now PorousFlow is block-restricted, which has allowed me to go further by applying only non-PorousFlow thermal diffusion in the underlying mantle, so avoiding the high pressure and temperature subdomain, which were very problematic for the water EOS.\nI can figure out some reasons by which the model still does not converge. Possibly, the tabulated extrapolation of the EOS [which I still need] is perhaps not god enough, but more than that I believe the top boundary conditions are probably not still in a good shape, which is driving the convergence process towards wildly sampling the EOS out of reasonable  P-T values.\nTo help me finding out the issue(s), I\u2019ve been back to using box synthetic models of partial domains and playing with the boundary conditions. The attached image represents a model [after 6300 year simulation time] corresponding to the input file below. This model represents a block of porous material completely submerged [its top is at -3000m] under the ocean [other areas in my real model are sub-areal, in unsaturated conditions toward the surface]. That is, in this simple case it is assumed the model is top-bounded by ocean water, which can enter and exit freely the top of domain. No flow can go through the bottom, and flow should freely go in & out through the side boundaries [representing a continuation of porous matrix materials].\nThe bottom of the domain is [DirichletBC] at 800 \u00baC, representing a heat source from an upwelling melting body coming from the mantle. Porosity is constant, and permeability has a Gaussian-decay away from the center of the domain towards the sides, such that it allows for convection to develop only towards a centered column in the domain.\nI had hoped that this should still be an easy case for MOOSE-PorousFlow.  This synthetic model eventually converges, but still it goes through several steps relatively early in the simulation [~200 simulation years ] where it struggles to converge, and it samples out of the [very wide] tabulated range of P-T for the EOS. Overall I\u2019d say the model is too slow [if I run it with a simple fluid, it is more than x100 times faster, but then the convection does not develop, so it is not realistic at all], and I am wondering if there is an issue with the BCs, which aggravates later on  in the \u201creal-case\u201d simulations [where the range of pressures and temperatures is wider, including unsaturated conditions] to the point of preventing convergence at all at the initial steps.\nAs you can see in the image, the hydrothermal plumes at the top of the domain have a natural shape, apparently leaving the domain without extraneous effects. To get this I\u2019ve been playing with  PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink, for both pore pressure and temperature. By playing with the parameters for these BCs I\u2019ve finally got hydrothermal plumes that do not tend to vanish nor to rebound when they reach the top of the domain. So, from a visualization perspective they look reasonable.\nStill, being the convergence so problematic at several steps throughout the simulation, makes me think I am doing something wrong. The input file can be directly run with the standard MOOSE+PorousFlow+FluidProperties modules plus the attached fluid properties file. The input files and tabulated EOS it calls [I can upload the 2.2GB Exodus output file after 10000 yr if that helps; simulation is ~3h with 'mpiexec -np 4' my iMAC] is at https://github.com/garciapintado/MOOSE_porous_flow_stuff.git\nHope that you can help to spot  input errors and advise on ways to make the convergence go faster [as said, I am mostly suspicious of the BCs; and not even certain to be applying correctly the left and right \u2018PorousFlowOutflowBC\u2019 conditions, as the solution is not as symmetric as I would have expected regarding the lateral fluxes].\nBest wishes,\nJavier\n\u2014",

                  "bodyText": "Hi @garciapintado\n@WilkAndy knows I love these convection problems!\nI think your main issue driving your convergence problem is that your maximum tilmestep size is too large. I set dtmax = 1e9 arbitrarily, and each tilmestep converged in less than 5 nonlinear iterations and there was never a point where the solver tries to sample outside the specified pressure and temperature range. I also made a much smaller csv file of fluid properties to speed things up. Your one is 26 MB, so lots of entries. Most of the time required in  TabulatedFluidProperties is finding the correct position in the array for interpolation, so less points in your csv file = faster lookup. I'm not sure how you made yours, but I like to use the python CoolProp library.\nAnyway, it looks like the warm water is escaping through the top, so your BC's look to be working for you. With the above changes, the following took about 45 minutes using 4 cores of my iMac. You could speed this up by coarsening the mesh in the upper regions and to the sides where nothing is happening (you could use less elements in the y direction and use the bias_y parameter, or even just refine in the middle section where everything happens).\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n    convection.mp4\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nPS: using SimpleFluidProperties doesn't lead to any convection, so all flow is diffusive which is why it runs so fast.

Many thanks!\nThe limitation of the maximum timestep to 1e9 also works for me [higher values as 2e9 still lead to some sampling out of the validity range of the thermodynamic tables], and I am also using your discretisation steps for P,T so the file for the tabulated properties is much smaller.\nStill, the simulation is not much faster on this side, and now and then I am getting some steps with take more than 10 nonlinear iterations to converge leading to smaller timesteps.

                  "bodyText": "Hi @cpgr,\nAssuming we\u2019ll be able to figure out why the \u2019simple block\u2019 simulation still is not as fast in my computer, in the meantime I\u2019ve been back to my original, realistic case, scenario [on which @WilkAndy started to help earlier this year], here I am even more doubtful about my BCs [actually, pretty sure they are wrong!] but kind of lost about how to do it properly. Sorry, if you think this is a separate discussion. I can wait until the current one on the simple block is solved and then open another one with this message, but hoped this would give context on the nature of the real application.\nFor info, I am pasting an image resulting from a coupled  mechanical-hydrothermal simulation done with Matlab. I have done this is Matlab in a pretty raw way [splitting all operations], and I\u2019hope to do it more properly in MOOSE, including some geochemistry [anhydrite deposition to close the pore space\u2026]. I already have a mechanical code in Matlab, which by now the plan is to keep using it. The idea it that every 10000 years [the matlab mechanical model timestep] the matlab mesh [an evolving Lagrangian] would be exported to MOOSE, who would do the hydrothermal part and return the thermal state and the porepressure to Matlab. And so on. At least by now, I\u2019d do the coupling just by system files forth and back every 10000 simulation years. The total coupled simulations would run for several millions years if we can afford that. The bottleneck is the hydrothermal part, which likely will run at a few years timesteps in MOOSE-PorousFlow.  So, the computing time it would take to do the hydrothermal part is critical to face the problem. The pasted image results from my current simple coupling between the mechanical and hydrothermal flow after ~10 Myr of hydrothermal activity [only the temperature feedback goes by now into the mechanical]. It shows the permeability field and the isotherms. The convection that develops around faults looks fine to me. I also believe that the hydrothermal activity extends too much towards the subaerial part, and don\u2019t know how much of this is an artifact. In any case, the lack of geochemistry here [e.g. anhydrite deposition] seems to lead to unrealistically long-lived hydrothermal activity. My hope is to solve these issues in MOOSE+PorousFlow.\n\n\nThe second pasted image indicates the blocks I am using into MOOSE. So, in MOOSE, I am considering a lower block [not governed by PorousFlow], where only heat conduction applies [\u2018nopore\u2019]. The upper blocks are governed by the PorousFlow dictator. The central part of the domain is submerged under the ocean [this covers the continental shelves; roughly the width of the \u2018sediment\u2019 area], while towards the sides, there is a subaerial part, where only barometric pressure should apply.  By now, I do not want to simulate the mechanical part in MOOSE as this is done in Matlab, so this would be a ThermoHydro coupling in PorousFlow.\nAlso, I am not really interested in the unsaturated areas towards the top of subaerial part, but have to include them as well, as heat conduction should be considered in all the domain. To create the \u2018unsat\u2019 subdomain, I am simply making the assumption that a \u2018phreatic level\u2019 is above sea level by some 25% of the vertical distance between the topography and sea_level at each x-coordinate. My idea of doing so is to simply induce a mild flow from the sub-aerial part towards the submarine continental shelfs.\nA problem I am facing now is how to set these top boundary conditions. Can this be done with a single-phase unsaturated simulation? If so, how would one set the porepressure boundaries on the top of the subaerial part so a mild inflow [kind of emulating rainfall] replenishes the subaerial part as it drains toward the ocean?\nA first alternative [a] I\u2019ve considered is to say the \u2018unsat\u2019 block is also only subject to conduction. Then indicate some environment pressure and use PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink BCs for the porepressure at the interface between \u2018unsat\u2019 and \u2018crust\u2019. The flux allowed in this interface is very small, with the idea that it allows for some control of the porepressure at this interface but the small flux internal flux avoids some extraneous effects in the thermal field [i.e. I am not added the corresponding PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink for temperature at this inner interface, as conceptually I would not understand its meaning]. If I'm getting this right this would emulate a \"confined\" situation for the porous media under 'unsat', and the PorousFlowPiecewisewiseLinearSink would emulate the lack of the mechanical pressure, so continuously feeding the porepressure at this interface.\nA simulation for 10000 year with a simple fluid takes only 671 secs [but thanks to you I understand this is because the lack of convection]. This develops some anomalies in temperature around the \u2018unsat\u2019 area, which I believe is because these internal BCs, but still Darcy fluxes close to the ocean bottom look to be in the right direction. However, if I try a real fluid [now with your CoolProp script] the simulation crashes very soon with messages as:\n\u201cTemperature 271.179 is outside the range of tabulated temperature (273.17, 1300).\nA MooseException was raised during Auxiliary variable computation.\nThe next solve will fail, the timestep will be reduced, and we will try again.\u201d\nA second alternative [b], I\u2019ve been considering is to consider \u2018unsat\u2019 as part of the PorousFlow domain, so this block is also subject to convection. In reality I\u2019d favour this alternative if it worked. It is way slower than [a] for a simple fluid,  but positively the solution develops negative porepressures in the \u2018unsat\u2019 area, wich I understand is a good thing [still saturation is always 0, which I don\u2019t understand]. Again, error messages similar to alternative [a] appear and the simulation crashes soon for the realistic EOS. Considering that \u2018ptop_auxvar\u2019 is the sum of a constant barometric pressure [1 atm] + the pressure by the corresponding water column, used as environment pressure, that \u2018temperature_f\u2019 is the temperature field imported from matlab, and that `top_submarine\u2019 and \u2018top_subaerial\u2019 are respectively the nodesets under the ocean or over sea level, the BC block for [b] is as:\n[BCs]\n[Ptop_submarine_sink]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = porepressure\nboundary = top_submarine               # nodes touching the ocean bottom\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                      # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '0 1e9'\nmultipliers = '0 1e9'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_relperm = true\nflux_function = 100\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = mass_flux_top_submarine_sink\n[]\n[Ptop_submarine_source]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = porepressure\nboundary = top_submarine               # nodes touching the ocean bottom\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '-1e9 0'\nmultipliers = '-1e9 0'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_relperm = false\nflux_function = 100\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = mass_flux_top_submarine_source\n[]\n[Ptop_subaerial_sink]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = porepressure\nboundary = top_subaerial               # nodes top-bounding the subDomain for porous flow simulation\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '0 1e9'\nmultipliers = '0 1e9'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_relperm = true\nflux_function = 100 # similar to Ptop_submarine_sink to avoid shocks\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = mass_flux_top_subaerial_sink\n[]\n[Ptop_subaerial_source]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink  #\nvariable = porepressure\nboundary = top_subaerial               # nodes top-bounding the subDomain for porous flow simulation\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '-1e9 0'\nmultipliers = '-1e9 0'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_relperm = false\nflux_function = 0.001 # to be calibrated: should allow for emptying of porespace\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = mass_flux_top_subaerial_source\n[]\n[Ttop_submarine_sink]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = temperature\nboundary = top_submarine               # nodes touching the ocean bottom\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '0 1e9'\nmultipliers = '0 1e9'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_enthalpy = true\nuse_relperm = true\nflux_function = 100\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = heat_flux_adv_top_submarine_sink\n[]\n[Ttop_submarine_source]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = temperature\nboundary = top_submarine               # nodes touching the ocean bottom\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '-1e9 0'\nmultipliers = '-1e9 0'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_enthalpy = true\nuse_relperm = false\nflux_function = 100\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = heat_flux_adv_top_submarine_source\n[]\n[Ttop_subaerial_sink]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink\nvariable = temperature\nboundary = top_subaerial               # nodes top-bounding the subDomain for porous flow simulation\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '0 1e9'\nmultipliers = '0 1e9'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_enthalpy = true\nuse_relperm = true\nflux_function = 100 # similar to Ptop_submarine_sink to avoid shocks\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = heat_flux_adv_top_subaerial_sink\n[]\n[Ttop_subaerial_source]\ntype = PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink  #\nvariable = temperature\nboundary = top_subaerial               # nodes top-bounding the subDomain for porous flow simulation\nPT_shift = ptop_auxvar                 # [Pa] reference environmental pressure: 1 atm + water column\npt_vals = '-1e9 0'\nmultipliers = '-1e9 0'\nuse_mobility = true\nuse_enthalpy = true\nuse_relperm = false\nflux_function = 0.001 # to be calibrated: should allow for emptying of porespace\nfluid_phase = 0\nsave_in = heat_flux_adv_top_subaerial_source\n[]\n[Ttop_submarine_dif] # diffusive heat flux = -

This seems to be the case as the popressure goes towards negative but the simple fluid, but this does not seem to happen with the tabulated EOS [although the latter crashes very soon, so maybe it is a matter of time]. Still, none of them has a saturation below 1 at any point, which is not what I expected.\nDarcy velocities across the ocean bottom look similar in both [a] and [b] for the simple fluid. For illustration I'm sending a plot comparing Darcy vertical velocities in both, still with the simple fluid after ~6000 years of simulation ([a] is the one on top):\n\nIn summary, I\u2019m obviously doing things wrong and not understanding how these BCs interact with the model. Shall I upload to GitHub the input files so the simulation can be run if this helps you to help me? In the end I'd need to run this with the realsitic tabulated EOS.\nI understand this is complicated and would not like to take much of your time. If there is something I could do to make your help not a big burden, but still get it please let me know.\nJavier",

I haven't a smaller problem as this is derived from our realistic models of continental extension and rift generation towards oceanic spreading. A problem with coarser resolutions is that the faults do not develop so well, so we are stuck with this sort of problem size. Actually, our mesh in matlab has quadratic elements (a Tri6), and I am now importing it as Tri3 to MOOSE to make the problem faster and because in previous synthetic models with PorousFlow I found that in some circumstances that a Tri6 mesh did not converge while a Tri3 did! Also to make the problem easier to converge I am calculating by now the porosity and permeability fields in Matlab (approximately reproducing the PorousFlowPorosity ---simply cutting porosity below a threshold, rather than your non-negative porosity approach--- and KozenyCarman derived permeability formulations) and passing then as constant static fields to MOOSE (although eventually I'd like to do that also in MOOSE if everthing goes well; so they are updated along with the hydrothermal flow). About cutting in half down a vertical in the middle, I'd guess that if it works, it should work in all the domain. I need help but not sure how to help you to help me, and I understand that this application maybe is not so simple. If you think it'd be possible any useful, I could see to come to CSIRO for some weeks later after summer in Germany (after learning a bit more about MOOSE-PorousFlow).",
