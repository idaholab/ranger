The key adaptive mesh refinement concept in that paper is to use a coarse mesh for the initial set up and then refine/coarsen the mesh as needed to reduce computational cost. As shown in the following picture, 1) the top-most active layer contains 1 element in the build direction; 2) elements near the top surface are refined; 3) elements far away from the top surface are coarsen; 4) elements near the part boundaries are refined. I want to implement this concept with MOOSE. However, I got some problems.\nSuppose a block of size 4e-3 x 4e-3 x 4e-3 is initially meshed with 5x5x5 elements. The layer thickness is 50e-6, so that 4 refinement levels are needed to reach such a cell size. The top surface moves every second as defined by CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier  and an AuxVariable. An error message is displayed: \"The block '1' has not been found in the network\" when I run the code. I know that if I use 80 (4e-3 / 50e-6 = 80) elements, the code can run. However, the initial mesh in such a case is already a fine mesh and I can't coarsen the mesh to a larger size. How can I get the mesh to look like the picture?\n\n[Problem]\n  kernel_coverage_check = false\n  boundary_restricted_node_integrity_check = false\n  boundary_restricted_elem_integrity_check = false\n  type = FEProblem\n[]\n\n[Mesh]\n  [gen]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 3\n    nx = 5\n    ny = 5\n    nz = 5\n    xmax = 4e-3\n    ymax = 4e-3\n    zmax = 4e-3\n  []\n  [active_domain] #the initially active domain\n    type = SubdomainBoundingBoxGenerator\n    input = 'gen'\n    block_id = 1\n    bottom_left = '0 0 0'\n    top_right = '4e-3 4e-3 50e-6'\n  []\n  [inactive_domain] #the initially inactive domain\n    type = SubdomainBoundingBoxGenerator\n    input = active_domain\n    block_id = 2\n    bottom_left = '0 0 50e-6'\n    top_right = '4e-3 4e-3 4e-3'\n  []\n  [sideset_top]\n    input = inactive_domain\n    type = SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator\n    normal = '0 0 1'\n    block = 1\n    new_boundary = 'sideset_top' # top boundary of active domain\n  []\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [T]\n    initial_condition = 300 #Kelvin\n    block = 1\n  []\n[]\n\n[AuxVariables]\n  [layerZ]\n    [AuxKernel]\n      type = ParsedAux\n      expression = 'z - 50e-6 * ceil(t/1.000001)'\n      use_xyzt = true\n      execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_BEGIN'\n    []\n  []\n[] \n\n[Kernels]\n  [conduction]\n    block = 1\n    type = ADHeatConduction\n    variable = T\n  []\n[]\n\n[MeshModifiers]\n  [addLayer] \n    type = CoupledVarThresholdElementSubdomainModifier\n    coupled_var = 'layerZ'\n    criterion_type = BELOW\n    threshold = 0\n    subdomain_id = 1\n    moving_boundaries = 'sideset_top'\n    moving_boundary_subdomain_pairs = '1 2'\n    execute_on = 'INITIAL TIMESTEP_BEGIN'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [thermal]\n    block = 1\n    type = ADHeatConductionMaterial\n    specific_heat = 1\n    thermal_conductivity = 1e-3\n  []\n  [density]\n    block = 1\n    type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'density'\n    prop_values = '1'\n  []\n  [dummy_mat_inactive]\n    block = 2\n    type = GenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'dummy_mat'\n    prop_values = '0.0'\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  # In 3D, back = 0, bottom = 1, right = 2, top = 3, left = 4, front = 5\n  [bottom]\n    type = ADDirichletBC\n    variable = T\n    boundary = 0\n    value = 400\n  []\n  [side_top_BC]\n    type = ADConvectiveHeatFluxBC\n    T_infinity = 500\n    heat_transfer_coefficient = 100\n    variable = T\n    boundary = sideset_top\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = PJFNK\n  petsc_options_iname = '-ksp_gmres_restart -pc_type -pc_hypre_type -pc_hypre_boomeramg_max_iter'\n  petsc_options_value = '201                hypre    boomeramg      8'\n  end_time = 80\n  dt = 0.1\n  nl_rel_tol = 1e-10\n  nl_abs_tol = 1e-12\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  exodus = true\n[]",

I want these elements to be at the same level as the finest.\n\nThis might not be tied to updating the sideset. it could be:\n\nthe adaptivity step is not run after a sideset update but after. This would mean we refine the old version of the boundary, then move the boundary. You can use Debug/show_execution_order to see how the user objects are executed. Adaptivty should have some verbosity so you can compare the ordering of the two\nthe adaptivity set up is such that the most refined version is not at the sideset. This would be the complex interaction of the the two markers. It's unlikely but then again you really have to check the error indicator to predict how that ErrorFractionMarker behaves",

We can see the addLayer executed first and the side_updater second, then the boundary_marker, error_frac and combo executed after the calculation of each step. In this case, even though the simulation moves to the next step (e.g. from step 1 to step 2), the boundary in the makers is still the old version one, so that we will see the mesh refinement is always one step later for these top most elements. A tricky setting might be to develop a Custom Timestepper and add a small time step before each current step.

We need the subdomains to be updated (by addLayer) then we can re-define the boundary between the two subdomains.\n\nYes. I already set the execution_order_group = -1 for both the addLayer and side_updater, the results seem to be the same as previous.\nBeside the current issues, I have another question: As shown in the figure below, the moving boundary contains 3 segments. We set the whole moving boundary as one marker in our input file, so that elements near this moving boundary are refined to max_h_level, resulting in a huge number of elements. But actually, for regions near these two orange lines, we hope that the elements could be as coarse as possible.\nIs it possible to keep the moving boundary the same, but make the elements near the orange segments coarser? If the mesh is coarsened then the moving boundary could be changed and another issue is how to ensure that the moving boundary moves correctly to the next layer when the mesh size is greater than the layer thickness.",

                  "bodyText": "Thanks for your question @HyungseonSong-plasma. The test result uses a very coarse mesh in order to speed-up the simulation time, so the waveform is quite distorted using the test mesh. The mesh you should use here is described in the documentation: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/electromagnetics/benchmarks/DipoleAntenna.html\nHere, I mention that you should generate the mesh using the Gmsh tool and the .geo file included in the test directory of the dipole antenna example. Using that file, you can navigate to the folder and then call Gmsh on the command line to generate the mesh quickly:\ngmsh -2 dipole_antenna_1G.geo -clscale 0.2 -order 2 -algo del2d\n\nYou should have a .msh file as the output that you can then use in the input file (within the Mesh block) to run the case again at higher resolution.\nRegarding normalization: in the data presented in the example, I am using a rather rudimentary boundary condition to excite the antenna. Therefore I couldn't, at the time that I made the example, guarantee the particular value of the electric field, but could guarantee the general waveform. Presenting the data in normalized form made more sense. What I mean by this is, performing the following calculation:\n$$E_{\\text{normalized}}(x, y) = \\frac{E(x,y)}{\\left|E_{\\text{maximum}}\\right|}$$\nHopefully this all makes sense. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them!",

Later on i'm trying to implement a open water body to the right and simulate the thermal influence of burried electrical cables on groundwater and open water bodies.\nI have a groundwaterflow from the left to the right that i implement over a FunctionDirichletBC with the porepressure. The gas pressure i set fixed to atmospheric pressure (101325 Pa). My gradient is 0,1 m/m and my model does have a width of 20 m. So the height difference of the groundwater from left to right border is 2 m.\nFor the groundwater i use the Water97FluidProperties and for the gas phase i planed to use the NitrogenFluidProperties but then the code takes forever to compute the residual, so i use the IdealGasFluidProperties. In hopes to simplify my code and better the convergence i also used the SimpleFluidProperties but they gave worse convergence than the Water97Properties. I also reduced my timestep in order to improve convergence but that didn't have a great impact.\nThis is my first big project and i'm kinda lost on what to do so i hope somebody could help me or point me in the right direction as to what is causing the bad convergence.

In hopes to simplify my code and better the convergence i also used the SimpleFluidProperties but they gave worse convergence than the Water97Properties. I also reduced my timestep in order to improve convergence but that didn't have a great impact.\n\nThis is good feedback. I think these other properties have been implemented for correctness rather than performance. The trick here to speed it up is either do what you did, or use a TabulatedFluidProperties. This can be used to generate a tabulation (using a different fp object) then load the tabulation and only use that (no need to specify fp anymore)\nWith regards to convergence issues, this page should help:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/application_usage/failed_solves.html\nnotably it would be good to know (on a small mesh) if the problem is well posed and does have any singular value",

Would the TabulatedFluidProperties be less precise than the Water97FluidProperties? And for the check with a small mesh. Do you mean dimensionwise like 1 x 1 m with nothing in the mesh apart from the block?\n@cpgr Yes i got the same mesh working with PorousFlow1PhaseP and a temperature at the cable.\nIsn't the model i sent with constant temperature? Because i only set an IC for the Temperature so the FluidProperties could be choosen.\nTo the difference with the IdealGasFluidProperties to the NitrogenFluidProperties. They don't really make a difference it just takes longer. So the only difference is with the SimpleFluidProperties.

And the temperature increase could be handled by a OutflowBC.\n\n\nFor the complex grid with the circle it shows a simmilar behaviour. For the first time steps it is running fine and at some point ist starts stagnating. It just shows a corious behaviour for the gas pressure:\n\nAnd following on that also for the saturations of the two phases.\n\n\nWould you say it would be the easiest to just adapt the IC and BC for the gaspressure? I would have thougt that the line of saturation change would be higher, closer to where i set the pp with the gradient. So going from 10 on the left to 8 on the right.\nBut otherwise i would say the convergence issues are handeld. Thank you !!!",

CFMS have been utilising MOOSE in a number of projects beyond the nuclear sector and want to bring together experts from academia, RTOs and industry to foster the UK MOOSE community. The idea is to have a combination of talks from across the user base, highlighting the industrial challenges faced and the capabilities of MOOSE, hopefully prompting discussions as to how MOOSE can be applied.\nWe are starting to put an agenda together for this event and gauging interest from the community. It would be really helpful to know if this is something you would be interested in attending or have any suggestions. Please feel free to reply to this or contact me directly.\nThanks in advance.\nUpdate January 2025\nThe registration page is now live, date is the 27th February. Link to the registration page:\nhttps://cfms.org.uk/article/2025-uk-moose-conference-register-your-interest/",
