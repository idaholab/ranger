I'm not understand this.\nDose computeQpResidual() not mean computing $-R_h$?",

And so sudo must now always be used when performing operations which require write access (such as mamba <insert any command here>). This is a woopsie mistake that should have been fixed immediately with sudo rm -rf /mydata/mambaforge3, and then reinstalling mambaforge without using sudo.\n\nI cannot save and install from my home directory (as suggested by the instructions), this is due to the settings on my work system\n\nIf this is true, this is a serious limitation imposed on by your administrator.\nThere is nothing preventing you from installing MOOSE to anywhere you have write access. So if you must install MOOSE outside of your home directory, that is fine. Please attempt to reinstall mambaforge3 as suggested above. The only constraints: you cannot use sudo when installing Mambaforge, or building or running MOOSE or building/running your MOOSE-based application.\nIf you have to use sudo, then you must always run as root instead: sudo su -. This is due to how environment functions are not inherited during the use of sudo. Example:\n$ init_conda() { echo \"hello\" ; }\n$ init_conda\nhello\n$ sudo init_conda\nsudo: init_conda: command not found\nThere are functions being called when working with Conda.

However, the initial temperature of the mold and cast largely differ on their scale, former one is at room temperature and later one is very hot--liquid phase.\nI have one question regarding the solution suggested: What's the difference between the InterfaceDiffusion and PenaltyInterfaceDiffusion? Looking on moose documentation PenaltyIntefraceDiffusion handles the continuity between the domains providing penalty value, but other does not. So, could you please explain me which condition these two kernels are suitable?\nThank you again for the help and suggestion.\nAshok",

In single-phase systems, the convention is to set porepressure = 0 at the transition between full saturation and saturation < 1.  PorousFlow uses this convention.  However, in reality we know that at this point, porepressure equals atmospheric pressure (eg, 101kPa).   Therefore, if you are going to use Water97FluidProperties or any other FluidProperties equation of state that uses true pressure (and not the single-phase \"i'm going to pretend there is no atmospheric pressure by defining porepressure = 0 at the transition to full saturation\") then you have to add atmospheric pressure on to PorousFlow's single-phase porepressure.\nEg, if PorousFlow's single-phase porepressure = 0, then you've got to evaluate the FluidProperties using pressure = 101kPa.\nEg if PorousFlow's single-phase porepressure = 8MPa, then you've got to evaluate the FluidProperties using pressure = 8101kPa\nEg if PorousFlow's single-phase porepressure = -50kPa, then you've got to evaluate the FluidProperties using pressure = 51kPa\nThis is really annoying, I admit, but is just the convention used by single-phase solvers.  The problem really comes when the PorousFlow's single-phase porepressure = -1MPa (or something < -atmospheric_pressure), because then you'll end up supplying FluidProperties with a negative pressure, and your simulation will crash.\nSo....   my recommendation is to use TabulatedFluidProperties: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/source/userobjects/TabulatedFluidProperties.html and manually do the shift with atmospheric pressure, and also (critically) extend to negative pressure.  This extension will likely be very important for convergence, even if your physical system never enters this regime in reality, because MOOSE will explore the regime as it iterates towards the solution.  I suggest do NOT simply use constant density and viscosity in this regime, but instead use some sort of exponentially-decaying thing as porepressure goes to negative infinity.  Eg, use a constant bulk modulus.  The problem with constant density (and viscosity) is that, because density doesn't change, MOOSE sees no penalty in making porepressure very negative - it might be essentially solving  Ax = 0, and with A = 0, then x can be anything.\nA",

If you look at DGDiffusion you will see that any term involving the diffusion coefficient will disappear if the elemental values of _grad_u and _grad_test are zero. Essentially all you have when order = CONSTANT is a penalty term for jumps in the solution. You can try running our 2d_diffusion_dg_test.i with order = CONSTANT and you can see that the error asymptotically is approaching a constant (the error does not decrease linearly as you refine the mesh)\nPostprocessor Values:\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| time           | dofs           | h              | l2_err         |\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n|   0.000000e+00 |   0.000000e+00 |   0.000000e+00 |   0.000000e+00 |\n|   1.000000e+00 |   4.000000e+00 |   7.071068e-01 |   4.293667e-02 |\n|   2.000000e+00 |   1.600000e+01 |   3.535534e-01 |   3.182482e-02 |\n|   3.000000e+00 |   6.400000e+01 |   1.767767e-01 |   2.031878e-02 |\n|   4.000000e+00 |   2.560000e+02 |   8.838835e-02 |   1.296973e-02 |\n|   5.000000e+00 |   1.024000e+03 |   4.419417e-02 |   9.107862e-03 |\n|   6.000000e+00 |   4.096000e+03 |   2.209709e-02 |   7.314127e-03 |\n|   7.000000e+00 |   1.638400e+04 |   1.104854e-02 |   6.529575e-03 |\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+",

Basically the hybrid rDG/CG scheme you suggested in order to bypass the difficulty associated with a two-phase Rhie-Chow interpolation.  Many simple test cases run very well (I am using upwind).  The AD system is truly awesome by the way.\nApproach has difficulties when full 6 or 9 equation model is solved when the liquid phase doesn't exist. I plan (hope) to revisit once a segregated solver is available in MOOSE. That would allow me to solve the phasic momentum equations together first.  Then the mass and energy equations would not see velocity as a non-linear variable but would see it as an AD value with associated derivatives (e.g., pressure).\nThe above has to do with the boundary between a fluid region and a solid wall.  I would like to take advantage of CFEM for solid heat conduction.\nThanks for all the help,\nJoe",

I am about to quit for today and will give this a try tomorrow.\n\nTheroetically, I do not see any issues with coupling different types of elements.  However, I believe this has not been tested before,  so you might have some troubles there.  Let us know what you find out.",
