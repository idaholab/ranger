I want the names of the generated sidesets to differ from their corresponding side sets.\nThe only way I can see to do this is by renaming all the node sets using BoundingBoxNodeSetGenerator, but that is a tedious solution. Is there a straightforward way to do this?\nThanks!",

This is possible in MOOSE with a Userobject; just add it to your PorousFlow app. I have done it with other codes.\nAn option for COMSOL is CPqPy.\nIf you know C++, you can also fully couple the codes by linking both libraries together, but this is definitely harder.\nFinally, it's probably better if you use Geochemistry. As native MOOSE code, it will likely be faster, and the MOOSE team has put a lot of effort into making MultyApps smooth and very functional. You can definitely benefit from that capacity too.\nI hope it helps.",

Say we want to simulate a heat conduction problem of a filament of ink being deposited onto a hot plate. We only want to solve the heat conduction problem in the ink. I have block 0 for air, 1 for ink, and use element activation to change air elements into ink elements, and desire to let the newly activated ink elements have an initial ink temperature. We tried the following:\nCase 1: I only define variable T Temperature in the ink block, and diffusion and HeatConductionTimeDerivative kernels in the ink block. It will report the error \"Each subdomain must contain at least one Kernel\" indicating that I need to define a kernel in the air domain.\nCase 2: I define the variable Temperature  in both the air and ink block, and I need to define a kernel for the temperature in the Air domain. To make sure I get the correct initial condition for the newly activated elements, I just used a HeatConductionTimeDerivative for the air. Because this kernel is just a time derivative, so it is enforcing the air domain solve \\dot T=0, meaning it will maintain an initial temperature after solving. Even though this gives me what I need, it is making the system much larger and with extra costs. I checked kernel_coverage_check = false, but it is for the entire domain, not just an air block. Is there a way to just enforce this for a block? I want to exclude the air elements from our calculation before being activated to be ink. Thanks.\nBest,\nXiang",

T is already a nonliner variable that exists in block 1, and I was trying to initialize the T in the newly activated elements (activated from block 0 to be in block 1, which do not have T defined before activation) for only ONCE right after activation. So I should not use AuxVariable in this case based on your comments.  When the simulation starts, the initial ink has T01=20 C, and the newly activated ink needs to be initiated to a different value T02=30 C. So the use of\n[ICs]\n    [T_IC]  #-- initial condition for T of the newly activated ink element\n      type = ConstantIC\n      variable = T\n      value = 30\n    []\n[]\n\nwill not work as it will also set the initial condition of the ink at the start of the simulation to be 30 C.\nSo to be clear, I was trying to initialize the newly activated ink elements with a temperature value that I can define in the input file. Note that the elements do not have T defined before activation, and the temperature value to be initialized at the time of activation could be different from the initial condition of the ink elements that exist at the start of the simulation. Any further comments? Thanks.\nXiang",

For finite elements, as an example, if you use Dirichlet BCs then you no longer enforce global conservation and consequently a flux measured by a postprocessor might appear \"wrong\". However, it is still correct within finite element approximation error.\nFor a finite volume discretization, yes you should ensure that your forms in your postprocessor exactly match what's going on in the finite volume kernels/bcs",

Could you explain why this happens?\nAlso, 'The damage model only has the effect of decreasing the stress computed from the elastic strain' here the elastic strain is mean the pure elasticity not including the spring's elasticity in the creep model?  just use Young's modulus instead?\nThanks a lot for your help with this.\nBest,\nDeyan",

That is because the accumulation of inelastic strain makes the material less stiff than it would be if it were purely elastic.\nWhat I meant in that statement about the stress computed from the elastic strain is that all the inelastic models compute elastic and inelastic strains. The stress after computing inelastic response, but before damage, is computed as C * \u03b5_e. That elastic strain is reduced from what it would be in a purely elastic model because of the inelastic strain. The stiffness of the springs in the units of the Kelvin Voigt model will affect the inelastic strain that you get from the creep model.",

The current beam element implementation is almost completely in MOOSE and doesn't use much libmesh (@bwspenc please correct me if I am wrong). There are a couple of options here:\n\nYou could do a quick and dirty implementation like @roystgnr described (for the case where the stiffness matrix is not in an integral form, which is your scenario, I think). We already have a template you can start with in MASTODON in the material called LinearSpring, which can be used with line elements. This material implements a simple, diagonal stiffness matrix for a 6-dof line element. This can be extended to the stiffness matrix you provided above. I actually recommend this method to begin with. (Note that in MOOSE, we create the mesh with line elements, assign appropriate number of DOFs, and then use the Materials to model it as a beam, truss, or a spring. This is different from traditional structural engineering software.)\nYou could also extend the current beam element implementation in ComputeBeamElasticity and StressDivergenceBeam objects. This is less straightforward, since this implementation is based on a 6-dof assumption.",

We select the number of points in the Gaussian rule in order to integrate a polynomial of order 2*p + 1 where p is the order of your finite element basis. So if you are using first order Lagrange shape functions, we would select a number of Gauss points needed to integrate a polynomial of order 2*1 + 1 = 3. We do 2*p to be able to integrate a mass matrix exactly and we add an additional 1 for ... well I'm still not quite firm on why we add it but @roystgnr has some explanation that involves Frobenius norms.\nAnyway let's take the first Lagrange example. We want to be able to integrate a 3rd order polynomial exactly from our 2*p + 1 rule. We can do that with 2 Gauss points (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature for details). So if using a first Lagrange basis you will see 2 quadrature points for a line element. For a quad element, the tensor product of line elements, you will see 2x2 = 4 points. A hex, 2x2x2 = 8 points.\nAs to where the points are located, the Wikipedia article is a good reference. For 2 points, on the reference element, they will be located at +/- 1/sqrt(3)",
