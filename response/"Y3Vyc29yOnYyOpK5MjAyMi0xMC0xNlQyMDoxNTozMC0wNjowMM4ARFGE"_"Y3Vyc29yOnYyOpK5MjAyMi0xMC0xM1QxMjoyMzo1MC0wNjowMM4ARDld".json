In the end, we will sum up all the residuals from two equations together such that residual from eq 1+residual from eq 2=0 ?\n\n\nSimilarly, if we have momentum equations in 3 directions, will we sum up all residuals from 3 directions and let it =0?\n\n\nIn the Navier stokes equation, we may have a double derivative of velocity in the viscous term, after we multiply the test function, we still have a gradient of velocity which is one variable I want to solve. whenever I use _grad_u to represent it, moose tells me some error. Is it because the grad_u (gradient of velocity) is a tensor since velocity is a tensor?\n\n\nThanks a lot.\nJ",

Thank you.\nToday I learn the navier_stokes. I find that there are two methods used to write the kernels for incompressible and compressible fluids in the navier_stokes module.\n\n\nUsing ADKernels. In the related ADkernels, the velocity is a vector and is not defined as 3 components.  The strong form residuals are defined as properties in the Materials and are directly used in the related ADKernels.\n\n\nUsing Kernels. In the related kernels, the velocity is a vector and defined as 3 components.  Each component is a scalar. The weak form residuals are written in the related Kernels.\n\n\nI find that the incompressible fluid has the above two methods, but the compressible fluid only has the Kernel method. So I have questions about them.\n\nInCompressible fluid\n\n(1) Is there some difference between the two methods used for incompressible fluid besides their intrinsic differences (e.g., the ADkernel doesn't need the hand-coded Jacobian, etc)?\n(2) How could I choose them? Is the ADkernels with strong form residuals better than the Kernels with weak form residuals?\n\nCompressible fluid\n\nCan the ADKernels method with strong form residual be used for compressible fluid? How could I choose between the strong form residual and weak form residual if I use ADkernel method?\nThanks for your help.\nJ",

That is the point of automatic differentiation, to be able to compute the derivatives of the residual to form the Jacobian.\nADKernels still use the weak form. What you are seeing creating the strong form residual is for the purpose of SUPG stabilization. The weak form is still used for most of the solve\nI recommend using ADKernels and implenenting the weak form",

I would like to describe some of the problems I encountered in the development of turbulence programs.\nI had finished a kind of two turbulence model which is Wilcox k-omega turbulence model, and I had finished testing some important cases like the \"2D Zero Pressure Gradient Flat Plate Verification Case\" and \u201cbackward-facing-step Case\". When I simulated the above simple cases, convergence is fine and from the computed solution I could find that the relationship between u+ and log(y+) compared with the DNS solution is about the same in the \"2D Zero Pressure Gradient Flat Plate Verification Case\". But in other complex cases, I always face a big issue which is a convergence problem. As I know, in other FVM programs we need to use some method to stabilize the simulation for turbulence equation in particular the production and dissipation term, but in FEM programs I wonder if there is a method to stabilize simulation like SUPG/PSPG.\nLooking forward to your reply. Thanks.",

I am sorry that my description may not be accurate, so you did not understand what I mean.\nYes, I did add SUPG stabilization to the k and omega equation according to the journal article named \"Overview of the Incompressible Navier Stokes simulation capabilities in the MOOSE Framework\". But due to the production terms of those turbulence equations are too complex to add the jacobian term to matrix by hand. Then I tried to add those jacobian terms by AD, which will cause non-convergence. In other words, my Jacobian matrix is right made by hand, but it is the production term of those turbulence equations is complex that causes the convergence problem even though I had added SUPG to those equations. So I wonder if there are need to add other stabilization methods to those turbulence equations to stabilize those turbulence equations' simulation, or if there are some other details worth noting I did not know.",

I tried to run with the FDP(Finite Difference Preconditioner) which could build the perfect approximate Jacobian. But some otherwise solvable problems do not converge. So I doubt that the residual term of production and dissipation caused non-convergence.
