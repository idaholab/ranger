I have meshed with abaqus both and got some problems because, looks like, having two parts in a mesh does not work in moose. So I am trying to make an elastic analysis with a single part mesh composed of two ELSETs (solid1 and solid2). After a first elastic computation, in the second part of this work, I would like to import displacements but considering exclusively the solid2 elset  during all the new analysis. In fact, solid1 models the impactor that is not needed in the second analysis.\nthank you for any help.\nRegards,\nSab",

          "bodyText": "Hi All,\nI am working with discrete nucleation for recrystallization and would like to prevent new grains from overlapping with existing recrystallized grains. My thought to do this was related to the nucleation probability, which is already known to DiscreteNucleationInserter and in my model it becomes 0 in recrystallized grains. So I am coding an optional loop that would check if any points inside a proposed nucleus have a 0 probability (or less than some threshold), and if so it would either eliminate the nucleus or resize its radius to not overlap, depending on user options.\nWhat i am unsure of is how to access the value of _probability at different elements? I only ever see material property values being looped over the qp n one element. As a follow up question, if I can access any elements material property value is there a way to create a subset of elements to check. Ideally, I would only check elements that fall within a box around the proposed nucleus, and not the entire domain.\nThanks,\nFloyd",

I will create a material property that is 1 in the recrystallized grains and 0 outside, then the RadialAverage user object will take that and perform a spatial averaging, such that the value is between 0 and 1 as you approach the new grain areas. In this way when a new grain is being proposed it can check that averaging map to know how close it is to an existing recrystallized grain and adjust accordingly.\nI will have to modify the DiscreteNucleationInserter to access RadialAverage and then it should be straightforward to perform the checks and operations i need.",
