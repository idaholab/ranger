Figure attached, see anomalous region top left.\nIf I define the parallel_type = DISTRIBUTED this issue seems to go away.\nThe issue only happens when I am using more than 8 processors, and appears to get worse with the more compute used.\nDoes anyone have an idea why an homogeneous value is varying depending on which processor is used?\nIs this a known issue already?\nI know I could just leave parallel_type = DISTRIBUTED, but id like to understand the issue for the future.\nThanks for your help,\nLloyd",
