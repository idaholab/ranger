          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI recently added MPI communication to my app and ran a few tests to ensure that my MPI runs deliver the same results as my serial runs. But they didn't. So I started debugging and what I found was that my MPI communication works as intended but MOOSE delivers slightly differing nodal displacements for serial and MPI.\nTake the follwing input as an example and run it in serial and then with MPI. The nodal displacements will be very close but not equal. This seems like a minor difference but for my application this error adds up over time which leads to significant differences in my end result.\nnx = 2\nny = 2\nE0 = 1\nnu = 0.3\n\n[GlobalParams]\n  displacements = 'disp_x disp_y'\n[]\n\n[Mesh]\n  [domain]\n    type = GeneratedMeshGenerator\n    dim = 2\n    xmin = -5\n    xmax = 5\n    ymin = -5\n    ymax = 5\n    nx = ${nx}\n    ny = ${ny}\n  []\n  [top_right]\n    type = ExtraNodesetGenerator\n    input = domain\n    new_boundary = tr\n    coord = '5 5 0'\n  []\n  [bottom_right]\n    type = ExtraNodesetGenerator\n    input = top_right\n    new_boundary = br\n    coord = '5 -5 0'\n  []\n  [top_left]\n    type = ExtraNodesetGenerator\n    input = bottom_right\n    new_boundary = tl\n    coord = '-5 5 0'\n  []\n  [bottom_left]\n    type = ExtraNodesetGenerator\n    input = top_left\n    new_boundary = bl\n    coord = '-5 -5 0'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Physics]\n  [SolidMechanics]\n    [QuasiStatic]\n      [all]\n        strain = SMALL\n        add_variables = true\n        incremental = false\n        generate_output = 'stress_xx stress_yy stress_xy strain_xx strain_yy strain_xy vonmises_stress'\n      []\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[BCs]\n  [no_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_y\n    boundary = 'bl br tl'\n    value = 0\n  []\n  [no_x]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_x\n    boundary = 'bl'\n    value = 0\n  []\n  [disp]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    variable = disp_x\n    boundary = 'tl'\n    value = 0.5\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [elasticity_tensor]\n    type = ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor\n    youngs_modulus = ${E0}\n    poissons_ratio = ${nu}\n  []\n  [compute_stress]\n    type = ComputeLinearElasticStress\n  []\n[]\n\n[Preconditioning]\n  [SMP]\n    type = SMP\n    full = true\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Steady\n  solve_type = Newton\n[]\n\n[VectorPostprocessors]\n  [disp_x]\n    type = NodalValueSampler\n    sort_by = id\n    variable = disp_x\n    contains_complete_history = true\n    execution_order_group = 10\n  []\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  csv = true\n[]\n\nSo my question is: Is this a known effect and if yes what is the reason for the differing displacement results in serial vs MPI?",

The finite element approximation of the true solution should be unique with the discretization parameters chosen.\n\nIndentical to the tolerance or completely indentical even at the n-th decimal outside the tolerance?\n\nClose to identical to the tolerance. But there are many caveats. The relative and absolute tolerances behave differently, and the tolerance is in terms of residuals not in terms of how converged each DOFs is.\n\nShould the serial and parallel solution be exactly the same when using LU? Because it isn't.\n\nShould be close given that the preconditioning is supposed to be serial. Maybe not all implementations are serial. You need to look at the PETSc documentation, I don't have all the specs of all PCs in mind",

          "bodyText": "Hello MOOSE users!\nI ran two-particle sintering simulations in a 2D domain and I tried to extend it to a 3D domain. For computational power issues, I considered 2 x 1/32 of particle without modifying any geometric or material-related parameter.\nThe simulation was successful and, on a graphic level in Paraview, the 2D and 3D solutions coincide. However, when I plotted geometric and energy-related graphs, these are very different from the corresponding case in 2D.\nI tried to do some debugging and among the Postprocessors I used, I cannot figure out how NeckAreaPostprocessor operates (and so ElementIntegralVariablePostprocessor), because I don't have much experience.\nThanks!\nSimone",

Penetration is not detected for one or more secondary nodes. This could be because those secondary nodes simply do not project to faces on the primary surface. However, this could also be because contact should be enforced on those nodes, but the faces that they project to are outside the contact patch, which will give an erroneous result. Use appropriate options for 'patch_size' and 'patch_update_strategy' in the Mesh block to avoid this issue. Setting 'patch_update_strategy=iteration' is recommended because it completely avoids this potential issue. Also note that this warning is printed only once, so a similar situation could occur multiple times during the simulation but this warning is printed only at the first occurrence.\n0 Nonlinear |R| =

However, the two different material physics are dependent on each other. Therefore, I am planning to do a coupled simulation. The computation will look like:\n\nFirst run input1.i file to solve the first physics and get the output file (input1.e) with grain structure and grain boundaries.\nNext, import the grain structure and boundaries from input1.e file to input2.i file and solve the second physics. Get the input2.e file from this step with output grain structure and grain boundaries.\nFollowing that feed the grain structure and grain boundaries from input2.e file in the input1.i file and solve the first physics again.\n\nThese simulation steps will repeat for a certain time.\nWould you be kind to let me know, how to do such computation in MOOSE? Do I need to use a Multiapp system for that? If so which Multiapp system will be the most appropriate for these problem?\nI would appreciate your advice.\nThanks, and best regards,\nZahid",

Generally you can define the mesh either in child app or parant app using this option.\nWhen you want to run child app in spacfic position(s) you need to set position otherwise just leave the setting as it is (I think so).\nTo have control on the outputs, check \"Transfers\" objects and use the proper one based on your problem.\nRahim",
