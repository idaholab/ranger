My system is 3D, my mesh uses HEX20 elements, and I was hoping to have everything second order.\nLooking at my contact pressures, I noticed that they alternated large positive and negative values from one node to the next. Going a bit further, I noticed the same thing was happening with nodal_area (though with signs reversed). I tried going back to a simple generated mesh with just nodal_area calculated and the problem persists for second order elements in 3D.\n\nI'm not actually sure this is incorrect, but it feels wrong in my bones. Negative areas aren't physical. However, the sum of the nodal_area values is correct (checked with postprocessor). On the other hand, there are many (infinite?) possible weightings of how the sum is done that would give the correct total area and not have any negative nodal_area values.\nI tried messing around with quadrature options and the results are the same (obviously the integral over a constant converges quickly).\nAny thoughts? Should I try to stop thinking about this? Would an alternative weighting of the area sum be more realistic?",

          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI'm currently grappling with an issue in my implementation of an anisotropic scattering feature based on the SN method. Despite numerous checks and improvements, my test results remain peculiar. The scalar flux distribution oscillates akin to trigonometric functions, with flux magnitudes roughly symmetric about zero. I suspect there might be an issue with my implementation approach.\n\nHere's a brief overview: I've discretized angular flux as a variable, with the program assigning an AnisoKernel for each angular flux during execution. Typically, in other implementations, anisotropic scattering involves converting angular flux to flux moments, multiplying with higher-order cross-sections to obtain higher-order scattering sources, and then converting these sources back to angular flux at discrete angles. However, in my MOOSE-based implementation, I've consolidated these steps into a single formula within AnisoKernel, directly calculating angular flux from angular flux.\nI've validated the calculation formulas through various means, so they seem sound. And, when I set all higher-order scattering to zero (meaning I'm using the code for anisotropic scattering but effectively performing calculations equivalent to isotropic scattering), the results behave quite reasonably.\n\nHowever, this is my first time using JFNK and assembling residuals to solve equations. I'm concerned that my approach with AnisoKernel might be incorrect. When utilizing solve_type=PJFNK, residual convergence slows down progressively and eventually halts without convergence. Only by resorting to solve_type=NEWTON did the program produce the peculiar results.\nCould you please advise if my implementation approach is erroneous? Should I separately declare variables to compute and store flux moments and higher-order scattering sources, then utilize these sources to obtain scattering source magnitudes at each discrete angle?\nI'm eager to hear your insights and suggestions.\nThank you,\nhityyds",
