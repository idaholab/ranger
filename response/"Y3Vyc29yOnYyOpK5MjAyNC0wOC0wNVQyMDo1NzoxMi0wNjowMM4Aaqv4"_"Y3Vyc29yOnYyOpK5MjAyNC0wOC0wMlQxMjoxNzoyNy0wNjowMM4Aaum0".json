Is there a way I can use it for all the elements - I need the average of the value for all the elements.\nJust FYI - I know the average value (it is one of the constant global values in the input file). I need it to be used in a AuxKernel I wrote. This value does not change throughout the simulation. So, any other alternative way of handling it is also appreciated.\nThanks in advance,\nRaghunandan.",

But the calculation of the function behaves erratically.\nThe function I would like to use in a ParsedFunction is:\nexpression = 'if(t<79500, 0, 1/(1 + exp((80000-t)/50) ) )'\nBut even if I start my solve at t = 79500 s, it fails immediately with:\n`Time Step 1, time = 79510, dt = 10\nPre-SMO residual: -nan\nPerforming automatic scaling calculation\nNonlinear solve did not converge due to DIVERGED_FNORM_NAN iterations 0\nSolve Did NOT Converge!`\nAt t = 79500, exp((80000-t)/50) = exp(10) = 22026 which shouldn't be causing the NAN error.\nSo I've tried an alternative expression for the logistic function (without an if statement since for t<<80000, the exp term should tend to zero):\nexpression = '1 - (1/(1 + exp((t - 80000)/50)) )'\nThis code runs, but the value of the function calculated with this expression stays stuck at zero, even when t = 80500 and higher, where it should tend to unity.  This makes even less sense to me than the nan error.\nHowever, if I let my solve start at t = 0 and use:\nexpression = '1/(1 + exp((500-t)/50) )'\nthen everything works fine.  The functions increases sigmoidally up to unity at about t = 1380 s and beyond.\nSo I can \"force\" it to work in this way and then append this bit of the solve to previous output up to 79500 s, but this is rather inelegant and time-consuming.\nWhy can the function expression cope when the logistic function mid-point is at 500s, but not at 80000 s (for t>79500 s), even though the range of values of the argument of the exp function is the same?\nIs there some setting I can change to get the solve to work around 80000 s?",

For example, dividing a very large value by a value which is very close to zero, or calculating the logarithm of a very small value may overflow the result, as well as multiplying two very large values. Raising a negative number to a non-integral power may cause a NaN result, etc.\nAs a rule of thumb, the library will (by default) detect invalid operations if they are invalid for a range of values. For example, square root is undefined for all negative values, and arc sine is undefined only values outside the range [-1, 1]. In general, operations which are invalid for only one single value (rather than a contiguous range of values) will not be detected (division by the exact value of zero is an exception to this rule) nor will overflow/underflow situations.",

My moose (numerical) solution now matches my analytical solution for Lubby2, as you can see below. There is a slight deviation between 5 to 10 days, but it's fine. The only thing is that I got these results by multiplying my numerical results by a factor of 0.1. My analytical solution is in percentage (i.e., I multiplied the actual results by 100%). In reality, I should be multiplying my numerical results too by 100%. It shows that my numerical results are higher than the analytical solution by a factor of 1000. I don't know if I have to implement a correction factor somewhere or not. If you could help with a suggestion, that would be awesome. Thanks.",

My issue is that the rollers are reset into their original position after the displacement step. I have tried StepPeriod as well as TimePeriod without success. The input file is provided below and I would be very grateful for any advice on how to get this going. As a side note, I used DisplacementAboutAxis for the rotation but when executed on the deformed mesh using use_displaced_mesh = true the rollers turn in on themselves, so I used ParsedFunction of my own for the rotation.\nMany thanks,\nJW\n# This test case creates a rectangular hollow section (RHS)\n# from a circular hollow section (CHS). \n\n[GlobalParams]\n  volumetric_locking_correction = true\n  displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z'\n[]\n\n[Mesh]\n  [mFile]\n   # Read mesh from file\n    type = FileMeshGenerator\n    file = roller_form_hex8_move30_4_thin_coarse.e\n  []\n\n  [create_sideset]\n    type = SideSetsFromNodeSetsGenerator\n    input = mFile\n  []\n\n   length_unit = m\n   patch_update_strategy = iteration\n   patch_size = 20\n   allow_renumbering = true\n[]\n\n[Physics]\n  [SolidMechanics]\n    [QuasiStatic]\n      # Parameters that apply to all subblocks are specified at this level.\n      # They can be overwritten in the subblocks.\n      add_variables = true\n      #incremental = false\n      strain = FINITE\n      use_automatic_differentiation = true\n      use_finite_deform_jacobian = true\n      generate_output = 'stress_xx stress_xy stress_xz stress_yy stress_zz vonmises_stress'\n      [block]\n        block = 'TROLLER SROLLER CHS'\n      []\n    []\n  []\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n  [stress_strain_curve_steel]\n    # Stress Strain Curve for Plastic material (steel)\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    x = '0.000 0.012 0.050 0.100 0.150 0.200 0.280'\n    y = '185.0e6 225.0e6 290.0e6 340.0e6 370.0e6 385.0e6 405.0e6'\n  []\n  [stress_strain_curve_al]\n    # Stress Strain Curve for Plastic material (steel)\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    x = '0.000  0.002  0.025   0.050    0.075  0.100   0.150    0.175'\n    y = '75.0e6 82.0e6 116.0e6 140.0e6  150e6  162.0e6 164.0e6 168.0e6'\n  []\n\n  [roller_step1]\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    x = '0    0.0250    0.0500    0.0750    0.1000    0.1250    0.1500    0.1750    0.2000    0.2250    0.2500   0.3000  0.5000  1.0000  2.0000  3.0000'\n    y = '0    0.1000    0.2000    0.3000    0.4000    0.5000    0.6000    0.7000    0.8000    0.9000    1.0000   1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  1.0000'\n  []\n  [roller_step2]\n    type = PiecewiseLinear\n    x = '0.2500     0.4792    0.7083    0.9375    1.1667    1.3958    1.6250    1.8542    2.0833    2.3125    2.5417    2.7708    3.0000'\n    #y = '1.000      1.0833    1.1667    1.2500    1.3333    1.4167    1.5000    1.5833    1.6667    1.7500    1.8333    1.9167    2.0000'\n    y = '0.000     0.0833    0.1667    0.2500    0.3333    0.4167    0.5000    0.5833    0.6667    0.7500    0.8333    0.9167    1.0000'\n  []\n\n  [disp_roller_step1]  # Roller initial displacement that forms RHS in Step 1\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    expression = 'vDisp * roller_step1' #* 4*t'\n    symbol_names = 'vDisp roller_step1'\n    symbol_values = '-6.0e-3 roller_step1'\n  []\n\n  [disp_CHS_step2] # Displacement of RHS CHS through rollers in Step 2\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    expression = 'alpha2 * roller_step2'#(0.3636*t-0.909)'\n    symbol_names = 'alpha2 roller_step2' \n    symbol_values = '-238.0e-3 roller_step2'\n  []\n\n\n  [x_rotation]\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    #expression = '(x0*cos(angle*pi/180) -

To remove this message, set 'use_legacy_material_output' to false in this application. If there are gold output files that contain material property output for which output occurs on INITIAL, then these will generate diffs due to zero values being stored, and these tests should be re-golded.\n\nLEGACY MODES ENABLED:\n This application uses the legacy initial residual evaluation behavior. The legacy behavior performs an often times redundant residual evaluation before the solution modifying objects are executed prior to the initial (0th nonlinear iteration) residual evaluation. The new behavior skips that redundant residual evaluation unless the parameter Executioner/use_pre_smo_residual is set to true. To remove this message and enable the new behavior, set the parameter 'use_legacy_initial_residual_evaluation_behavior' to false in *App.C. Some tests that rely on the side effects of the legacy behavior may fail/diff and should be re-golded.\n\nCurrently Executing\n    Computing Pre-SMO Residual\n      Computing Residual..

I can't just use a ComboMarker as all three polar variables exist on every point in the mesh and if the marker operating on polar_z marks for COARSEN, the markers for polar_x and polar_y will mark for REFINE and my understanding is that REFINE will always take precedence over COARSEN.\nAdditionally I was wondering if max_h_level can be block restricted.\nThanks",
