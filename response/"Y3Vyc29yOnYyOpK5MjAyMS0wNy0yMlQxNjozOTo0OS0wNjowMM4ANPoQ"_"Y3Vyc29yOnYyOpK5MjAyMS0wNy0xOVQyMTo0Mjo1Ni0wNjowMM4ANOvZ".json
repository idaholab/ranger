          "bodyText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm trying to implement the ACMultiInterface kernel in a 3-phase system and I would like the kappa terms to be functions of a separate order parameter (a different one than the \"eta\" order parameters from the interface). If a kappa term is defined as a DerivativeParsedMaterial as a function of theta (for example), will the changing value of kappa with theta be reflected in the ACMultiInterface kernel? And more importantly, will the ACMultiInterface kernel include the gradient of theta as it computes the divergence of the interface terms? If using a kappa term as a function of another variable is not possible, is there a workaround to get an equivalent effect?\nThanks,\nScott",

                          "bodyText": "Thank you for the response. I'm trying to implement a non-isothermal system with three distinct non-conserved phases, each of which has its own order parameter (representing the phase volume fraction),\nVariables:\nOrder parameters: phi_1, phi_2, phi_3\nTemperature: T\n\nFor brevity, I'll use phi_q to reference the order parameters in this outline. The free energy is a combination of thermodynamic terms (heat capacity and latent heat with phase changes) and coupled interface terms that may be different between any two phases,\nFree Energy:\nf(phi_q,T) = f_bulk(phi_q,T) + f_interface(phi_q,grad(phi_q))\nf_bulk(phi_q,T) = h(phi_1)*f_1(T) + h(phi_2)*f_2(T) + h(phi_3)*f_3(T)\nf_interface(phi_q,grad(phi_q)) = f_dw(phi_q) + f_grad(phi_q,grad(phi_q))\n\nI felt the ACMultiInterface kernel was most appropriate for f_grad as it handles the complex cross terms between each pair of order parameters and their gradients. I use a CrossTermBarrierFunctionMaterial for the double-well term f_dw. The evolution equations for the order parameters are then straightforward,\nEvolution equation for order parameter q:\ndphi_q/dt + L*df/dphi_q + penalty = 0 ;  q={1,2,3}\n\nThe challenge comes in deriving an evolution equation for temperature. The internal energy can be derived as\nInternal energy:\ne(phi_q,T) = f(phi_q,T) - T*df/dT = e_bulk(phi_q,T) + f_interface(phi_q,grad(phi_q))\n\nNote that the interface term is unchanged in this transformation because df_interface/dT = 0. The time evolution for temperature, with thermal conductivity k, can be expressed as,\nEvolution equation for T:\nde/dT*dT/dt + sum(de/dphi_q*dphi_q/dt + de/d(grad(phi_q))*d(grad(phi_q))/dt,q={1,2,3}) - div(k(phi_q)*grad(T)) = 0\n\nI'm not positive that the grad(phi_q) terms needs to be included here, but I don't feel that I can discard them out of hand. Even if I could, the de/dphi_q terms are themselves quite complicated as they must include portions of the cross terms from f_interface. It may be that the effect of these terms is negligible enough that they can safely be discarded, but I would have to actually set it up in order to verify it, which is what I hope to avoid.\nTo dramatically simplify this problem I could recast f_interface as being a linear function of T. The internal energy would then simply be e(phi_q,T) = e_bulk(phi_q,T) and the evolution equation for T would become\nRecast internal energy and evolution equation for T:\nde_bulk/dT*dT/dt + sum(de_bulk/dphi_q*dphi_q/dt,q={1,2,3}) - div(k(phi_q)*grad(T)) = 0\n\nHere the de_bulk/dphi_q terms are very straightforward. This modified formulation seems mathematically complete to me, and much less taxing computationally. I had hoped to implement it by making the kappa term in the ACMultiInterface kernel a simple linear function of T, but it doesn't seem to be a built-in option, hence my question.\nThe ACKappaFunction you suggested looks promising. I suppose I would use a different ACKappaFunction for each kappa value for a given order parameter. Does that sound right? Looking at ACMultiInterface, do you have any reason to think it can't be used with multiple kappa values each defined by their own ACKappaFunction? Please let me know if you have any other ideas or suggestions. Also, please let me know if you see a problem with my formulation or approach in general. Thanks again for your help!\n-Scott",

If it is, in fact pyramidal, Cubit doesn't have a built-in method for meshing it with hexes (though you could tetmesh it, then thex it into hexes...).  Meshing a pyramid is the great challenge in hex-meshing, look up \"Schneider's Pyramid\".\nOne option may be to build a mixed-mesh on that volume - essentially building a pyramid-tet mesh on the orange volume that interfaces with the hex elements on the neighboring volumes.  If your volumes are imprinted & merged, trying doing the following:\nvol {orange_volume_id} scheme tetmesh\nmesh volume {orange_volume_id} \n\nOne general comment regarding meshing, not necessarily specific to Cubit is that you should mesh the \"most constrained\" regions of your model first.  And then mesh the \"next most constrained\" (which are often the neighbors of the most-constrained regions) and so on.",

The tet meshing library that they provide will automatically produce a mixed tet-pyramid mesh if the input volume has even a single quad element within its bounding surfaces.\nMore information\nThe reason this was challenging is because you have a pyramid-like volume (grey).  In this below picture, you made a webcut (highlighted) that resulted in this volume's shape/topology:\n\nYou additionally assigned a block that only contained this exact volume.  This is likely intentional -- you may have a body-load or material assignment that needs to take up this exact region.  However, if you didn't mean to have this be a separate block, and it could be united with the blue volume below it, then you could generate a mesh more easily as the resulting body would be prism-like (and thus sweepable):\n\n\nNotice how we've effectively relaxed a constraint on the mesh, which makes it easier to hex-mesh.  This may not be a constraint you're able to relax, but it hopefully shows that sometimes \"less is more\".",
